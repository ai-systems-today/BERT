 although the 'chat' was slightly slow i believe this was a technical issue your colleague who i dealt with was very helpful one issue that did arise was that i first connected with one person he asked me to get some information which i did however when i returned with it the 'chat' conversation had automatically ended i was later told it disconnects after 60 seconds of inactivity i am disabled so have mobility problems and thus slows me down perhaps this should be made clear at the beginning of the conversation? i then had to restart the conversation with another operative who resolved the issue ironically if the instruction manual had been clearer it may well have helped thus removing the need to contact philips at all 
after your colleague helped me with the information i requested i can now use the appliance which is very good by the way ;delighted

 i just wanted to say thank you for the recent customer support experience i had following an issue with a product 

the case reference is 60 0014658091 

when i logged the issue i was actually looking for an email address and all i could find was a whatsapp link i was a bit dubious about this for some reason so didn't have great expectations when submitting my request i think this is because it is the first time i have used whatsapp in this context so it was a bit alien to me 

i have to say i am converted now and feel this is the way forward for customer support to be handled as long as the person responding to the whatsapp channel is on the ball and i am really pleased to say the person i dealt with panorea was brilliant 

they were really friendly professional knowledgeable and helpful and my issue was resolved in super quick time it is also more immediate and personal than email as you are dealing with an actual human rather than a nameless faceless email box and therefore it felt responses were faster than email 

i thought i would take the time to praise the customer support representative and the experience i have as people are very quick to complain but not always as quick to praise ;delighted

philips products are of good quality and i have received courteous and immediate support but i have not solved my problem it seems that it is impossible to find spare parts both online and at recommended stores plus for very recent appliances i find this absurd and annoying fact ;disappointed
speedier answers and knowing the answer;disappointed
offer alternatives;disappointed
if the device was 2 to 3 times to repair and comes back defective after each repair as it is sent then definitely something is wrong if you then propose to buy another coffee machine from philips and also to pay something and this is rejected because the supervisor is asked for permission just insisting on the guarantee then that is more than sad the customer therefore gives philips a new opportunity and this is simply knocked out a pity ;disappointed
produce a product that is flawless for more than 2 years ;disappointed
to hear the people right and give correct information my machine is still losing water;disappointed
a cup with the designation scf751 05 is missing the valve unfortunately i have the cash register;disappointed
when requesting a order cancellation on the same day as ordered agree to request rather than let be dispatched at the moment i have to wait for delivery just to return it back for a refund doing this i now have a possible 2 week wait i have now decided to purchase from another retailer this i see my experience as a slowing down tactic by philips very disappointed ;disappointed

to make a courteous offer if they have already produced mistakes you can contact me if you send me a replacement and not a ridiculous 10  voucher contact ;disappointed
it was said that the responsible department reports back this never happened ;disappointed

we have sent the senseo coffee maker for repair the cost itself they later stated in the letter that the machine had been repaired by partially replacing the case we could not recognize that condition of the machine was as before and the damage criticized by us also appeared immediately finally we will pay the shipping costs for an unrepaired machine during the warranty period another call in your service center could not help us either it should be noted that the service representative was friendly and patient even if she could not help us ;disappointed

 dear ladies and gentlemen to send a new customer a welcome coupon on 31 12 2018 which on 31 12 2018 loses its validity already testifies to great incompetence wanted to use the same for a purchase on 1 1 2019 and learned by accident that he was only valid until 31 12 2018 in spite of a new promise for a new welcome coupon i will now consider buying anything from you at all and i will make a big advertisement for your incompetence and special customer friendliness in my circle of acquaintances greetings from a grossly disappointed your friedrich pusch ;disappointed
unfortunately the purchase difficulties with the order wrong statements or billing by the customer service reversal  has worked really well so far the whole process has taken a quarter of a year until finally the open amount has been set to zero it has cost me a lot of nerves strength and time so that i will never order again in your house the grade i give for your house is insufficient ;disappointed
 if a device a few days after the expiry of the warranty period in my opinion breaking point plug connection on the board torn off but is absolutely necessary for charging the battery is broken then helping me a good address does not really tell the first call to the hotline came a few weeks before after a long wait and 3 times connect i told the whole thing and the data was also recorded shortly thereafter the connection was interrupted and instead of receiving a call there was no feedback  except a subscription to the newsletter when calling on 28 11 the lady was more competent and also told me that the case was recorded with the processing number 60 0013304044 one sees however not responsible but refers to the goodwill department since there are enough other providers on the market i will certainly not beg go for a few euros credit or the like next time i will see shortly before the deadline if with a philips device still everything right and otherwise complain about the same  unfortunately i have a few reasons of product differentiation ;disappointed
unfortunately your employees can do nothing better in the service area as long as philips sells very expensive toothbrushes where after about a little more than 2 years the battery is defective and can not be replaced ;disappointed
take customer concerns seriously and do not drive a cheap excuse ;disappointed
i returned the order because the parts you recommended were obviously wrong i originally approached you to choose the right filters when complaining and initiating the return your employee told me that i no longer have to worry about the bill at klarna on 30 12 2018 a request for payment from klarna came to me although i have long returned the package in the complaint i was told then that you can not deliver all the parts for my vacuum cleaner conclusion a pity a really good device that has been faithful services for years and although i have been a philips customer for a long time several tape recorders including the legendary 4419 hi fi components internet radio multiple home appliances i will be unfaithful to your brand and under no circumstances recommend you i have not needed spare parts for a while now but in the past that worked perfectly for you ;disappointed
more expiation not keen on the way the iron leaks condensation from the water cover have to mop it up every now and again so it doesn  ;disappointed

for such an expensive 'top of the range' product i am disappointed that you only provide a 2 year warranty secondly because it was a gift i don't have proof of purchase now the toothbrush is in the bin i won't be buying another philips sonicare ;disappointed
i didn't really get a resolution to my query i still don't have a charger for my appliance ;disappointed

the product is faulty or no spare part for half a year young device a shame  ;disappointed
i didn't get the answer on time i had to ask behind and only when i threatened to buy a cheap copy of the toothbrush i heard about you ;disappointed
my request could have been read carefully and so correctly respond to my request;disappointed
i was very disappointed that the big company philips is not able to supply its customers with small parts because of a no longer functional rubber seal in the lid the customer should buy a new coffee pot ;disappointed
customer friendly more good with warranty;disappointed
after i answered the 20 11 2018 with the following text i would have expected at least a response here is the content of my answer hello mr voss first of all many thanks for the feedback for whatever reason the noise after renewed brush replacement disappeared of course i use the original brush heads since these brush heads are not necessarily cheap it is annoying for me that the error was probably on the brush head and i had to change my head again after only 10 days since then the error has not occurred and therefore no longer necessary replacement sincerely rainer bach;disappointed
i and my concerns were not taken seriously  i expected more from philips ;disappointed
organize the spare part ;disappointed
to stand for the errors of their products;disappointed
right service and better privacy ;disappointed
it should have been easier to find customer services in the first place your website refers to a consumer care line and then it's impossible to find the number ;disappointed
respond to the customer and help ;disappointed
take concerns seriously;disappointed
in the standard emails is no indication where to send purchase receipts this should be correct and clearly somewhere so that you can send the document properly ;disappointed
the operator should know the products be able to respond to customer questions and try to solve the problem philips should take responsibility for the replacement of defective products and not delegate it to the seller ;disappointed
unfortunately my request was answered negatively unfortunately the spare part can not be ordered via the philips shop ;disappointed
you already know it;disappointed
deficiency and do not represent normality ;disappointed
 faster response availability of goods 
i still can't buy what i need ;disappointed
a few years ago when they asked me what tv to buy i suggested philips telling them that what spare parts are all the other companies have philips alone i happened to ask for an iron plate for my client and because they had not told me to close the iron to give it to my client and take it to get a new one with a fifty percent discount it made me so impressed that with the same money that would give me me to repair him bought a new one this philips i had in my mind unfortunately today you are directing me to outsiders who are sorry but  from communicating with them i understood these spare parts because it was not something that went wrong they never put them in their shops and that's where everything ends so you can have gentle employees to serve your clients but know how to measure the outcome for the customer in short i would prefer the old philips that would serve even with a delay of some time   the result  ;disappointed
do not report for weeks i sent the article back to the seller with the request to take care of it;disappointed
the answer email could have been saved our device has not worked from morning to morning and as advice we were told that we could simply buy a new set you would have at least a coupon or similar if we have been faithful for 4 years and want to buy a philips device again but this email has only caused us to look for alternatives ;disappointed
solve the problems so that it is done as desired the correcting done ;disappointed
the person i spoke to was polite and friendly but knew nothing about the products she just read from the web site which also had very little detailed information ;disappointed
anything;disappointed
 i have a problem with one of their products but i should contact the dealer in my case media markt  because my device works so well and only by the way until today stinks very unhealthy there is no exchange and no other solution from your side this is not a service i will probably exclude philips directly next time and prefer other brands in future purchases the lady on the phone was in my view neither customer nor problem solving oriented i would have the call with you in total i hung over 19 minutes including initial waiting loop on the phone can save completely too bad ;disappointed
resolved the issue;disappointed
i asked for assistance after purchasing your product shaving head there was only the offer of 10% when internet purchase of other products ;disappointed
by accepting the return;disappointed
they shared a link or the order part but i did not come to the part from the accessories because he was currently out of stock that was very unsatisfactory ;disappointed
respect appropriate advertising promises also ;disappointed
asked to return a faulty product before a new one was sent out which meant i was without my product for days not helpful for customers and no leeway on process;disappointed
speed up the repair of the product at least a little  it is more than a month that has been sent to repair  ;disappointed
the written correspondence i received was awful she seemed to take a quick glance at whatever was my previous email not tie it in with previous correspondence and make a wild and incorrect guess about what the complaint was about consequently on three separate occasions i received an email that was wholly inappropriate when i finally lost patience and demanded it be referred to another more senior person the complaint actioning improved immediately however as a customer who has bought philips products for nearly 50 years it was too late to avoid the feeling of disappointment and frustration at how it was handled tbh whereas in the past i have automatically bought phillips products for several appliances i am far from certain to do so next time i need one as i'm worried at how difficult it was to sort out a faulty product;disappointed
when you market a product you must also know where to find the pieces;disappointed
repair the device;disappointed
faster;disappointed
 i tried to register a christmas gift it will only take a minute not true it was an expensive gift and i needed to contact my daughter to see if she can register the brush for me ;disappointed
deliver the desired product according to customer service this does not exist but you could order it on amazon;disappointed
sometimes a telephone contact is easier than 10 emails  ;disappointed
message if you consider that this device will come at some point ;disappointed
the contact person on the phone was very nice friendly and competent but it is not understandable to me that if the seal is lost from the dust cover there is no substitute is normal by the meter there is only the entire lid the vacuum cleaner was bought on 13 7 2018 i was told it is also not a warranty case because it would have broken the seal but the loss is not a guarantee i wonder if the gasket was properly mounted how can you lose it immediately after two emptying of course i will in the future if the company philips does not agree to consider this as a guarantee think twice before me if i buy such a branded device again or rather buy a cheap no name product ;disappointed
give me the goods that i miss ;disappointed
i am still waiting for months for a credit of  40 to my account that you have agreed to do everything works so slowly i do not know as a company how you keep on top ;disappointed
we are sorry to answer this question for the smratclub that i collaborated i had the problem;disappointed
send missing manual german english in paper form for environmental reasons i do not consider sending in paper form as unacceptable as far as the package manuals in italian french netherlands and spain were enclosed only not in german english ;disappointed
the product under warranty presented a problem and i paid a spare part not inherent to the problem  it does not seem to me correct;disappointed
my actual request was not processed at all the promised coupon i have not received until today ;disappointed
i got some answers from an english speaking page and i don't remember when i bought the iron and finished the communication because you can probably see it in your computer system sweden therefore i did not go furtheri have now bought a new iron ;disappointed
actually helped instead of telling me to phone someone else;disappointed
you were not helpful in fixing my toothbrush just told me to charge it for longer ;disappointed
help me;disappointed
to offer a help solution;disappointed
well maybe it was the internet but we where cut off and then i could not get back all i wanted was to register my new trimmer to get the promised extended warranty that was on a leaflet inside the box your website is very difficult to navigate;disappointed

the desired spare parts in austria or at least in vienna make orderable and collectable ordering spare parts abroad where after 2 days and 2 phone calls my written request is still answered is extremely customer unfriendly in addition my philips device is not usable which is more than unpleasant ;disappointed
i was offered no solution to my problem ;disappointed
faster service still waiting for a cheque to be issued use royal mail tracking instead of just blaming them better staff that actually deal with the issue instead of just parming you off better wording of emails;disappointed

the reference to a competitor shop i would have rausbekommen even without customer service from philips the actual thought of glass the pot would not be received the next plastic jug smells again after some time and the tubes also and we clean the milk can every day there is never any milk in the pot overnight a standard response flat rate that does not help an end customer if your service center is paid after successful closed tickets i am not surprised by this procedure ;disappointed
i was not contacted and i was asked to send an email but all with too long times;disappointed
offer spare parts ;disappointed
i bought a steam generator iron and am troubled by it not working properly consistently do i need to buy a new one when it is only 4 years old? what do i do to get it serviced at a reasonable price?;disappointed
took a long time to get an answer;disappointed
one could have been followed up instead of having to follow up on their own nothing happened before i even contacted and asked for progress in the matter every time i contacted we came a step further had i not done so i would assume that it had still been on the spot ;disappointed
philips does not have the simplest spare part a plastic window for my kettle staff was very polite and i also looked for ways out but philips can not offer that courtesy and dedication top marks solution disappointing ;disappointed
still chat until the problem was resolved;disappointed
more personal service and not autoresponder;disappointed
try to solve the problem and not just refer to the online site spare parts could not buy my spare part individually have bought a completely new device pity ;disappointed
the article could have been sent directly after the first contact;disappointed
been more understanding and provided an alternative particularly when i had registered the product;disappointed
i have asked quite clear questions regarding the availability delivery of a water filter in the philips online store the questions were evasively answered with links to external shops like amazon however i wanted to inquire about the ability to deliver in the philips shop because i have countless coupons that i could not use due to unavailability in the philips shop these are now even expired because in the philips store articles over countless months are not available weak           ;disappointed
i had one year left of my warranty but as it was already a replacement it was void the tone of the representative was very negative and said best you could do was offer me a discount which would be sent in a email i went to your site and by signing up to the newsletter i got 15% off so i did when i got the email i was only given 15% which i already got and also you could not use that on reduced items i was very dissatisfied ;disappointed
i was served by kalli very promptly and with politeness but he was unable to resolve my issue though it wasn't his fault the fault lies with the design of the product ;disappointed

faster feedback and answers to my questions ;disappointed
take the customers seriously  and continue to help from your side i'm still waiting for an answer ;disappointed
nothing wrong with the response but took several weeks to get an answer and the answer was not to any benefit on a follow up question the answer took several more weeks and the only thing that came back was two links that did not work ;disappointed
i would have an answer or help expected that helps me and not the reference to their homepage if i ask a specific question i expect an equally concrete answer and not the reference to the homepage i do not feel like having time to look for suitable trading partners for their products a pity actually i would like to have bought one of their products sincerely michael kn ;disappointed
i wanted to cancel an order before it was sent but it seems this is not possible it should be ;disappointed
the first answer would have already been that the caps from the newer model do not fit i would not have needed to write a second email ;disappointed
be friendlier and grateful;disappointed
if the employee had also reported as announced after he wanted to get informed maybe he will still answer? i do not think so ;disappointed

by validating my guarantee verbally as opposed to online what happens to the consumers who do not have access to online services?;disappointed
the problem has not been solved yet e mails have not arrived and skillful ones have not been processed there was no further contact;disappointed
in my case it happened that i could not solve my problem through the two operators with whom i spoke but i solved partially by continuing the navigation on my own in the philips store site among other things as i also said to operators sometimes the information on the site is not clear ;disappointed
since i believe the matter is still open i would like a solution to the problem;disappointed
i have not received any notification from philips or klarna as i have been informed regarding my order and invoice this is not satisfactory ;disappointed
to place an order i did not get a satisfactory hilfe bei payment is offered on account but with anklikken this is not accepted ;disappointed
i bought a product which was very expensive and did not last very long and the problem was not solved i was sent another replacement which was faulty or the the charger should have been replaced which was not replaced ;disappointed
answer my questions correctly;disappointed
the customer service was totally incompetent in addition i was not really offered a submission of the device from the outset but it was only pointed to possible problems in which i mentioned that these are not problem is clarified through middlemen ;disappointed
honestly you could not really help us ;disappointed
i did not feel that my question was read and answered  also i was offered no solution except to order a device and try it  i do not need customer service i wanted to avoid all this sent back and forth ;disappointed
goodwill and customer orientation seems to be a foreign word for philips;disappointed
guarantee for spare parts only 6 months outrageous  ;disappointed
more attention to the product before it is sent to the customer;disappointed
i said in the 1st phone call that we have made the warranty extension of our coffee machine via media markt  i then sent on request the image of defective part thereafter on request including the proof of purchase and warranty extension which cost me a lot of time and effort because i do not belong to the young generation and i do not know so well about mails and computers then the very very annoying news that we can clarify our concerns only on media markt ;disappointed
offering longer time outs on the web chat ;disappointed
 offer solutions to problems with products we do not know when the app for the baby monitor will work again does not help thanks to the amazon supports i was able to give you back camera and buy a baby monitor without server connection from the philips support here was no help possible ;disappointed
the information i needed wasn't available and i had to wait for an email to get to me i had to do the research my self to find out weather to buy your product or someone else's surely you need poeple who can answer questions on the products you sell ??;disappointed
it was a goodwill request for my grandparents and even here you are in the case absolutely not accommodating this has nothing to do with service ;disappointed

by telling people what they say and not just talking about it;disappointed
the customer service has always been more sparkle than being do not even give 1 month warranty on defective spare parts even though the kva is not even 1 month old is miserable ;disappointed
received feedback i was promised;disappointed
even if you are not the right person to contact ask the solution internally from colleagues instead of just writing that the customer should turn to another service area ;disappointed
i'm not sure there was complete understanding of my question i would have liked to have spoken with someone ;disappointed
answer the question asked;disappointed
if i get a defective device then i already have the right to a new device without defects just because it was no longer available in myshop but in the normal shop already that should not be possible for you? i had to wait weeks and call 5 times and write some mails until i could return the goods and finally get my money back stress for nothing i had no device and i had to jump behind my money i have ordered a lot from you through the shop and was always happy but had not received a damaged device yet and never had to contact you that was the worst service i have ever experienced ;disappointed

defective coffee machine came to me i should send this back and order again why could not i just send a new machine? for me so unnecessary effort and in addition the price in the online store has also increased ;disappointed
required a power supply charger for the minivac hand vacuum cleaner fc6148 10 8 v which is not offered as an individual according to your customer service the answer was that i have the opportunity to inquire about the type number in the open market for replacement helpful for me would have been a source with an alternative power supply i also wonder why i buy a branded device from philips if i do not even get a power supply here so i will soon buy a low cost provider and defective in the part goes off in the bin kind regards reinhard kaufmann;disappointed

there was no service ever buying philips any more;disappointed
they were not ready to sell me a spare part i had to search the internet to get it it's probably about the money either expensive repair or new device so you do not keep customers;disappointed
there was no adequate response to my problem it takes a long time before anything happened then a lot of effort was required of me and it did not respond adequately a bad product was not refunded and again i was left without any real feedback and nothing happens very very bad customer service ;disappointed
by getting the use of danish mobile number for the app regarding dream folders;disappointed
find a problem solution still waiting for an e mail with a question answered;disappointed
clarify the problem with the first call ;disappointed
do not send a standard answer and deal with the facts ;disappointed
 unfortunately i did not receive appropriate information to solve the existing problem the mentioned service partners had to fit that there is no spare parts for an article that was bought in 2013 is sad ;disappointed
i would have expected that i also get spare parts for a vacuum cleaner from philips especially if i get this partly in other shops if the parking slot is not a spare part it must be sturdier so it will not break ;disappointed
pretty much everything to react in a reasonable time would be a start ;disappointed
take my concerns seriously ;disappointed
you could have suggested a suitable spare part;disappointed
reply to my 2nd email;disappointed
complaint was rejected;disappointed
i can not order a specific part anymore ;disappointed
and again a philips product which is no longer usable for me after a short time no real help from the support this was definitely the last time i bought a philips product i am disappointed with all dimensions ;disappointed
provide clear information about your products ;disappointed
for a product that clearly has a breaking point after only 4 years to offer any more spare parts convinced me in the future to buy any more philips products;disappointed
if it is possible to pick up the faulty home appliance since living in a city like rome it is difficult to take it to your service center because it is far from home office;disappointed
if i buy for 299 euro an airfryer and there is no manual this is certainly customer friendly on my request i receive a link to download 30 pages from the network and print out what does the customer who has no internet and thus no printer? sorry why could not i get the manual in book form?;disappointed
the offered paid repair was not your best idea ;disappointed
the spare parts available make for my fully functional device is an absurdity that there is nothing left ;disappointed

replacement kettle failed about a year after the first overall just past 1st purchase warranty constant boiling causing damage to kitchen cupboards discount offered as a gesture of 15% off a purchase from the site is the same offered for a first purchase ie it  s not worth anything so disappointed in phillips shoddy pr;disappointed
i expected that within the guarantee period the appropriate part is exchanged then i could have bought the same product from another manufacturer for the third of the price ;disappointed
if you ask a question the question was questioned a solution could not be determined the communication was very slow and unprovesionell an answer which was again more a question to my question took some 5 minutes ;disappointed
i found your website confusing and it continuously rejected accepting my email address by telling me it was already in use elsewhere and my password did not match i phoned and was dealt with most courteously and i was offered a 15% discount on the item all seemed well but i was still not accepted when trying to pay i had spent over 30 minutes messing about with your website and finally gave up and secured the product i required from another source ;disappointed
offer a solution;disappointed
if help is given and this does not lead to success it is not customer friendly ;disappointed
suggested solutions were not usable;disappointed
solve problems and do not provide convenient answers ;disappointed
product is broken unfortunately this is not discussed ;disappointed
been held out for 3 weeks same statement over and over again feels like my request is not taken seriously;disappointed
i can not request the application 16 times the operator should read more carefully to the chat ;disappointed
explain to me why the coupon should not apply ;disappointed
the problem was not the person in the chat who was actually very friendly and helpful but generally the appearance of philipps there is no online shop in switzerland from germany philipps does not deliver to switzerland and on the online order form you can not even enter a supplementary line for the address all very disappointing and i will not buy any more philipps products in the future ;disappointed
make the promotion transparent for consumers so i would not have needed customer support in the first place ;disappointed

in my opinion for a chat actually a direct conversation too long a response since i can also send an e mail  i did not have the impression that the employee was product safe superfluous demand for a circumstance that was already answered in the contact opening my startup question and in the final answer unfortunately no further wssertank available for this device ' were too many mistakes for me ;disappointed

 establish contact with the workshop to make the costs more transparent it is not worth paying extra 35  for a check up even though you know the problem well and only then will you be aware of the cost of the repair i was not mentioned the expected costs and also not rudimentary trying to make contact i am aware that their personnel can not give binding promises and price information through direct customer contact making contact with a person who can do that would be desirable apart from that i was titled as a woman which of course i corrected right away and shortly thereafter was informed by mrs christina sountourli again with the wrong salutation this is just unprofessional i also received messages that did not address my issue and landed in the wrong chat window and that too several times that i should turn then with my steam ir workshop of your choice can not be in the sense of philips in and of itself we were always convinced of philips products but that experience leaves us with the confidence in the brand and the associated support  ;disappointed

my query was very simple and i shouldn  t have had to call if the information on your website product i;disappointed
 as i already said the tips of your employees were initially unhelpful or not practical you can see this if you take the trouble to look through the correspondence between me and your colleague the testing of the device should be possible on site i find it too expensive and way too cumbersome to ship the device for just under 37  shipping and any scrapping included it was not about the scrapping of the device i wanted a solution for further use especially since the device is only 3 years old when i asked how long a repair lasts it was said it can take 2 weeks of course it can take longer   all in all their service could not help me this way i would have liked it if i had had the opportunity to have the device checked on site for free a concrete cost estimate and a specific repair period would have been called for that i would have taken the trouble to bring the device to the dealer ;disappointed

your ordering website is poor in 2 areas firstly when entering the name of my house i could only enter 5 characters names of houses are nearly always more than 5 characters secondly when entering a postcode your website only recognised my postcode if it had a space between the first 4 characters and the last 3 characters in my experience all purchasing sites i use allow you to enter the postcode in a single string without spaces to get around the house name i had to enter my house name in the surname field not a very elegant solution ;disappointed
the problem has not been solved i still do not have the promised warranty extension from 2 to 3 years when registering the product ;disappointed
the explanation which has been explained i have determined myself before but it is incomprehensible to me that heats the device again and then unnecessarily makes noise and power consumed in addition the period of the response was much too long crazy thank you;disappointed
the product is still not working after you sent a lead  i am not impressed with this product at all;disappointed
not to say first that we should solve with replaced brush and then want to have a receipt for product that you could have sent receipt that my daughter did not have when she as a dentist bought a toothbrush for me at the fair ;disappointed

provide the spare part;disappointed
exchange such poor quality ;disappointed
they did not even respond to our request therefore we are very surprised that we should now comment on your service ;disappointed

i have the airfryer xl i have always cleaned it in the dishwasher but now the emaile from the pot and fry basket gone off and unfortunately the basket starts to rust that should not be because us a representative has said that the things in the dishwasher can give unfortunately i never got a suitable answer but even i can recommend the airfryer so that i gave my 2 children each a xxl for christmas and my sister has bought equal to 3 for christmas sincerely simone kamp;disappointed
instead of helping or offering a replacement my problem would not be understood correctly and i have the feeling that my answer consisted only of text modules clicked together and i should first carry 1000 information together so that it helps me and if necessary supplies replacement ;disappointed
the operating instructions refer to a video on the website for maintenance unfortunately there are only the 3000 and 4000 series ? furthermore they offer a free warranty extension upon registration after a query with your chat it says after a few minutes not for your kafeemaschine even a fee based guarantee would not be possible?;disappointed
honest deal with the customer pure impudence staff all very friendly but all empty promises made the main thing quickly handled ;disappointed
it takes a little long time between the emails and when finally the spare part arrived in the mail it was the wrong part so i just gave up at the end ;disappointed
understood the problem fault with my shaver and offered a better result as the shaver has a definite design fault ;disappointed

you should listen to the customer better and take the problems seriously ;disappointed
reliable feedback ;disappointed

saeco incanto de lux sup 021ybdr spare parts no longer available ;disappointed
 by failing to ignore the query it seems like trying to avoid solving the problem my case has now been unresolved since 3 10 2017 case no 60 0008013799 + 60 0013938704 despite the fact that philips customer service already confirmed 4 10 2017 to want to refund the purchased blue control ;disappointed
the handling passing of the complaint took an unacceptable time about three months and it always moved only when i asked for it separately the only plus was that i eventually got the replacement product to the faulty state ;disappointed
say why i can not get a guarantee even though the product was not even a year old;disappointed
i sent the mail on 5 11 2018 on 11 1 2019 came a feedback there's nothing to add here ;disappointed
 i had ordered via bsw but it looks like the order was not posted to bsw i did not receive any notification that the item was shipped i did not get an invoice so i had to request it later the order processing is thus dog fault label the customer service took a long time and then told me that i should contact bsw i would have liked a customer service here ;disappointed
since i did not get a correct answer to my question it could have done better;disappointed
you are selling a not complete product the call center staff was very good very active very helpful but the filter holder without drip stop for sale is a joke i would very much like to have made the old drip stop but that was not and to ask for a new trofstop 10 00 euro is a lousy number and i'm sure he would not even have been able to assemble if the old part does not go out because nothing can move push stretch it does not work with the new part either i think philips should deliver meaningful parts completely ;disappointed
a gentler approach to a loyal customer would have been desirable pity philips;disappointed
take care of the described problem instead of 5 weeks to write mails;disappointed
it was not the products selected by mail what the customer actually wanted to have although he was said this after several statements on the phone specifically ;disappointed

i find it difficult to understand why philips cannot supply a replacement charging cable for my beard trimmer which is still working as new your latest models require cables of identical specification and which you supply with new products and which you could make available separately should you choose i am disappointed you appear unwilling to meet my request for supply ;disappointed
respond to my concerns;disappointed

very friendly acceptance of the problem 3 fold delivery for 1 fold order but follow up by philips not sufficient not timely by default mail without specific information and only after a renewed request done ;disappointed
show more goodwill;disappointed
no personal questions it took me 5 minutes until the nice lady on the phone said that i should have a look on the internet a waste of time ;disappointed
i spent quite a lot of time to damage all the information as a lawyer my time is dear and as mother short my product has broken down about 1 2 months after the warranty has expired and a bit of a discount for a new device my kuhn rikon kitchen machine has been running flawlessly for over 15 years although i need it several times a week i will not support philip in the future ;disappointed
advisor very helpful but disappointed my kettle just 1 month outside your warranty cut off point;disappointed
instead of evasive answers you could have been concrete ;disappointed
i could not be helped funny if i can not ask at philips itself where i can buy a specific product because so why not buy an online shop? i can also buy and deliver it online at apple;disappointed
unfortunately i got after 3 days only a message that the mail was forwarded in the first mail was something of 48 hours and also i have already counted here with an answer which helps me more specifically but i'm optimistic that things will move quickly now ;disappointed
by responding faster and fixing faulty products faster a case should not have to last for over a month ;disappointed
respond appropriately to our request we had to contact you ;disappointed

i could just have sent me the gift that sounded at 300 instead of wasting your and my time we are happy with our senseo this is the third machine we have now ;disappointed
supply the needed spare part for my vacuum cleaner a vacuum cleaner for 400  and then i get from the manufacturer no spare parts very sad under these circumstances that was certainly the last devi;disappointed
the employee on the phone was very friendly empatik and customer oriented but his helpfulness did not help me because the problem remained unsolved it was about hx9340 151120 not as you wrote in the subject hx9332 04 which i had in use for about 3 years as with the previous toothbrush the button is no longer functional after about 2 5 3 years  a clear sign of planned obsolescence the quality of this toothbrush is out of all proportion to the price i'm not ready to buy such an unreliable product every 3 years and i'm thinking about reporting the case of tv show file 20 19 monitor and the consumer center ;disappointed
since my device is still under warranty i should send a proof of purchase i did that and still the spare part unfortunately did not arrive until today since about 4 weeks ;disappointed
do not discount customers with a ridiculous discount ;disappointed
you didn't have the offer i had received info about in the store i bought philips from you also didn't have the item at their online store so the 40% voucher i got from the lady i chatted to was of no use ;disappointed
solve the problems;disappointed

to offer a repair of the expensive toothbrush it is only a loose connection and throw away the device is pretty sad in the age of the throwaway society  now the repair for 20 euros by another service provider the next toothbrush will be from oral b it is also sad that it is not possible to buy a single handpiece what should i do with another charging glass etc if only the handpiece is defective;disappointed
employee indicates wrong mail address of the goodwill department my diamondclean toothbrush is almost out of warranty and defective unfortunately neither a repair nor an exchange is offered on your part also it is not possible to buy only one handset individually everything else such as case charging cradle and glass is still in perfect order from a company like philips i actually expected more customer friendliness and above all a corresponding sustainability strategy furthermore the employee has told me that it is possible to extend the warranty for free by registering for 3 or 5 years i did not realize that i bought the toothbrush from my dentist ;disappointed
when buying the philips product to point out that you have no ersatzzusversogung ;disappointed
i haven't heard back from you as promised;disappointed
the problem described was very superficially tried to fix and after the first attempt directly set the customer service now i've researched the problem myself over several attempts and found out the malfunction of the tageslichtwecker that should have done their r & d and help me therefore definitely service inadequate ;disappointed
answer my question instead of sending me an instruction manual ;disappointed
 hello i have asked for proof of purchase for this item philips power pro ultimate cp0682 01 ergonometric handle i was recommended the simple handle although the above description is clear in addition my wish in the named online shop is not even available the contact request was answered with an apology only after 3 days you will be able to understand my dissatisfaction since i do not know how your customer service is organized networked i can not make any suggestions for improvement addendum the defective vacuum cleaner handle shows clear signs of fatigue because the battery compartment lid jumps off because the handle bends downwards reinhard schr ;disappointed

we purchased your sonic toothbrush which obviously has a known fault but instead of you dealing with this you have chosen to ignore the problem this is the second brush we have had the first was replaced under warranty but the second despite only being 3 months old and having the same problem was not we will not purchase a philips product in the future ;disappointed
speed up ;disappointed
it took a very long time to get an answer in the answer i was asked to send pictures of the damage i have not yet received an answer to this email so my problem has not yet been solved and i do not have a product that works ;disappointed

so far i have not received any feedback that the retour went through i ask for feedback by e mail according to retourverfolgung the article has arrived since a week ;disappointed
the response time to the complaint dropped and never came and finally the message came asking to reconnect if the matter is topical yet because the complaint warranty defect seemed never to have been dealt with etc ? in the end a message came up offering a new device at a discount not the guarantee but it's better than nothing the 5 year old warranty that has been heavily annoyed is not really like its word length ;disappointed
web site is entirely unintuitive as was this survey ;disappointed
the model details on the equipment didn't agree totally with the options to select the part spend too much time trying to validate it and then not fully sure;disappointed
i complained about my sonic toothbrush that had stopped charging this was the second unit that this has happened to and was told that the warranty was from the date i bought my original unit this doesn't make sense as each unit should have individual warranty i was offered a discount but considering the value that the sonic toothbrush costs didn't really attract me to buy another;disappointed
put written instructions and not just diagrams as to how to use your products ;disappointed
my problem has not been solved since 1 10 2018 so much for your customer service;disappointed

my shaver who is still sold in the shops you can no longer buy new magazines for  so my machine is useless therefore the supporter gave me 40% and a website in sweden where according to the supporter's statement i could buy the parts for a right high price i'm not buying philips again ;disappointed
e mail was not answered for more than a week pretty bad result i am grateful to chat cashier she took care of the job in style the customer service was provided in english which as such was not a problem because i could speak a language thank you also to sweden for being helpful it is disappointing to see a strange return process for a satisfaction guarantee where instead of having instructions and packet labels etc the package has to be sent to a somewhat suspicious actor there is nothing like a customer support phone number in swedish yes yes instructions are provided in swedish and english and for example a mail package then if the moneyback guarantee money comes from the product so good but i really will never buy anything for you to try under this satisfaction guarantee and i don't recommend it to anyone ;disappointed
you could have sent me replacement in a 1 year old device had expected more service for the money ;disappointed
i am disappointed with philips irons not with the service of your staff;disappointed
i was misinformed and realise the guarantee is useless as my complaint was considered 'normal wear & tear' ;disappointed
i no longer have access to myshop at the phone number 0800 6648300 i received the information to send an email to myshop dach@philips com instead of help i get this survey which does not help me at all ;disappointed
the one i talk to you was nice what annoys me is that your service does not apply to mediamarkt but at elgiganten you have to open and try the product how to know what you got in the christmas gift when you are not allowed to look what i wanted was to change me to a bigger one that would suit my needs better so i'm super disappointed with this but a good way to cook but the desire has disappeared because it is too small for what i want to do so it goes into a cupboard ;disappointed

the service by the person was already ok philps willingness to be goodwill is absolutely disappointing ;disappointed
hire a dane who is more technical felt that i was talking to a robot;disappointed
offer goodwill ;disappointed
better and more transparent coordination between the first contact person first contact person and the specialist department the first contact was very pleasant and customer oriented but the result was disappointing ;disappointed
answer faster than a month and answer the question you asked do not ask a new question and return another month later without answering either ;disappointed
not just be quick in the reminder emails;disappointed
the employees have to do things faster ;disappointed
the customer service adviser gave me link that doesn't exist to go into and follow to descale my iron i am highly disappointed because we never used that iron up to 20 times we have another iron that we use and is only the housekeeper who knows how to use that iron since january last year she left nobody used the iron again ;disappointed
address the problem instead of praising the product in the sky;disappointed
yes clas olsson helped me with the manual to the trimmer you couldn't help me;disappointed
more goodwill and congeniality;disappointed
unfortunately i was not helped the affairs are still not settled;disappointed
arranged with cups i was going to receive after i registered the product on their website 4 12 18 not referred me to another place to get them after all count on the fact that you who are responsible for registration also make sure that the customers get the ones they are promised not that i have to contact philipsredemtion@st se to call for the cups to be shipped when i registered the coffee machine;disappointed
more goodwill and customer orientation;disappointed
just please help me and not send any confused messages to help the customer and not to let them rest again as soon as possible ;disappointed
first customer service care took down wrong email address so never heard anything from philips regarding my faulty item;disappointed
i have had contact with 4 different people who all promised me a new steamer but nothing happens i have only been offered a worse model the last contact was today so maybe i can get a new steamer now it feels pretty hopeless ;disappointed
the link gave no product no the splash guard no help ;disappointed
the website obviously has some errors why under shop by category would you show identical repeated links in one case a link is repeated three times ;disappointed
held what was promised;disappointed
have a basic understanding;disappointed
simply doing what is promised in this case i have all claim requests answered the same day but the case was only after three requests with the success that my money was refunded after a month but after the time of the article in the philips shop now by 40% expensive case pp d 18803267 question should have the system;disappointed
i wanted to get as a tinker for my saeco espresso machine spare parts unfortunately you give her no spare parts a repair offered by almost 200 is not an 8 year old 100eur machine in question therefore i want to repair them myself it was only broken a sealing ring which i have bought at another load to 1 7eur in a pack of 10 pity that you obviously have nothing for real sustainability would the seal cost 3eur i would buy it so synonymous that you miss this money i do not understand i can not imagine that you have such a great profit margin per machine  anyway i would like to be able to repair my equipment as a craftsman ;disappointed
to pass me faster and to have the product;disappointed
good contact person good conversation percentage discount for next purchase in relation to their own cost and damage 3x repair own claims by purchasing 2 water filters travel and time very poor and not satisfactory ;disappointed
make better products that do not break;disappointed
no solution except the new purchase and then a medium device although i currently have premium;disappointed
by providing a replacement product that lasted more than 4 months;disappointed
to listen to customers and not immediately with the statement then you have no more guarantee to confront the customer;disappointed
everything the worst customer service on the market become very aloof brand we will see how long it continues ;disappointed
for my questions no technical answers could be given ;disappointed
the item description was unclear the representative was as confused as me;disappointed
offer better conditions after my expensive toothbrush turns on and off automatically after the expiry of the warranty;disappointed
make the machine as it was given to me for the preparation of pizzoccheri but with the dosage you exposed the pasta does not form changing the dosage the pasta is formed but from the chain comes out a paste so thin that it is not suitable for its true consumption ;disappointed
i wish you had stock of spare parts for products that have been discontinued ;disappointed
have a better return policy so that i am not supposed to pay to send the pack to you ;disappointed
an enclosed user manual no one can read a pdf file gr ;disappointed
given answer to the question about klarna as receipt when product number does not appear in them ;disappointed
margin;disappointed
if in a delivery no matter from where a product from their assortment is incomplete because the carton was not closed properly clinging to the carton hold ud man despite photo etc no spare parts sent because i do not have the bill reason it was a gift this double use should be in your dreams in the photo was product and delivery date why was not enough and the customer had to buy a part in addition sorry just sad ;disappointed
shorter response time ;disappointed
the lady on the phone ms engel could not answer our question and wanted to forward it to the department of your home no answer yet this was the 15 01 2019;disappointed
concrete information;disappointed
the call for customer service was unfortunately not helpful the employee was not sympathetic to the problem presented and was not very empathetic ;disappointed
black earlier and possibly given me alternatives to how i could have got hold of their products even if you do not offer it in norway for example say i can order it from their us website or something ;disappointed
explain and understand better;disappointed
you should have replaced the product we had two break just over a two year period due to water ingress on to the electrics product warranty should have started with the latest product ;disappointed
exchanged my faulty item;disappointed
with your discount you were still more expensive by 33% l think that  s not very good i will never buy a philips shaver aga;disappointed
buy answering me a lot quicker and sorting my problem out;disappointed
i could have answered my triple e mail a reminder about a missing feedback on my part and then closing the case even though i've responded to this feedback three times is more than disappointing ;disappointed
the product filter for coffee machine for which i have a voucher can not be ordered for months although i was promised by her side in a telephone conversation it will take only a few weeks these are already over then i do not need a coupon and i can buy the filter or the normal way or order ;disappointed

by sending me the form i need;disappointed
find my toothbrush again;disappointed
 i phoned twice on the first occasion the agent recommended the 6100 model which i purchased from robert dyas but will return as the pack was very disappointing compared to the diamond model 

the second agent gave me much more information but unfortunately could not help me with stock availability of the pink diamond i was able to purchase it subsequently on ebay 

i really like the diamond toothbrush but i am having trouble with the on off switch which jams i also like the wet dry pink razor these are really lovely feminine ranges 

thanks ;disappointed
was passed on to another department had to contact again has not received a reply;disappointed
 just solve my problem and not tell me what you can not do? i am very surprised that you do not supply spare parts for your weakest parts on the ironing board disappointing i have sent photos and still it is not possible to get the parts only if the board was in guarantee ?????? our ironing board is just 1 year from the warranty i would pay the parts so synonymous but i do not even get an offer  so you make it that i buy from another manufacturer in the future bad service pity ;disappointed
 a simple item like the smart clean fluid cartridge missing from my shaver smart clean purchase should be more readily and quickly available i first reported this on 22nd december and i have still not received the replacement cartridges 
 i would have thought a big company like phillips would have such a simple item in stock all the time ?? ;disappointed
found a solution to my problem which i have undoubtedly ended up with ;disappointed
partner in the region;disappointed
i would have expected answers to my specific complaints instead you expect my assessment to an actually weak and evasive opinion on serious quality problems of the product mentioned for me under service i understand something else the single point stands for the relatively quick response to my request the rest is simply weak and unsatisfactory for a company like philips ;disappointed
tried to register online via my mobile but kept saying it didn't recognise my email address even the implied kept getting emails from you the chat room was ok so we agreed i should try the computer instead that worked your website is terrible and not easy to find what you want ;disappointed
they have neither been able to remedy the problem nor told me as promised;disappointed
philips could be more accommodating the warranty of our device expired 3 weeks ago ;disappointed
the service was fine it was the product that was the question;disappointed
 when i was waiting for an answer from person i was chatting to i was disconnected as 'i hadn't responded in adequate time'
 by offering repair of something faulty at phillips's cost not my own ;disappointed
i asked for a test report from the air cleaner to see the filtering of the different particle sizes and to confirm the reported data from an unbiased report but i got the same text that can be seen online no report;disappointed
you could have answered faster since i didn't get an answer i bought myself a new product ;disappointed
package 3 times to the wrong address although several times the correct address was communicated by e mail;disappointed
swapping enough to give 20% it would not be my fault;disappointed
the customer service was friendly and fast the result however is very disappointing there are no spare parts for a device that is not even three years old and cost over 100 euro that's incomprehensible to me;disappointed
i cannot find a replacement part comb for my model philips qc5055 hair clipper ;disappointed
cc create centers assist in the country and city m;disappointed
the relationship with those who bought your product assistance for those who like me abroad worthy of the name you bring in the world i'm in romania for assistance and everything is complicated you have to bring the apparatus from them and you have to pay even if you are under warranty we have requested a replacement for aqua trio pro i have paid the spare part plus shipping for it i requested the set of wheels that in the previous paid assistance had lost and that at the time of delivery for my lack not i checked being packed i was delivered to the two wheels without the supports now i should still address to those and proposed assistance to have the media still paying for delivery ;disappointed
contact us in time if something goes wrong;disappointed
the lady was very good who handled the problem but very disappointed that something as simple as a replacement bulb wasn  t available on something that we bou;disappointed
you could black much faster ;disappointed
contact was very friendly unfortunately there is no interest on the part of the company policy in exchanging known faulty constructions for customer satisfaction to adequate conditions ;disappointed
simply better inform and do not say that i can dispose of the defective brush head and not send back and about 1 week later after i disposed of it then to say we need a picture of the defective brush head that can not be serious;disappointed
make sure i can change my product to someone i can use this design miss is not good for anyone ;disappointed
 employees train with regard to payment options and delivery methods employee did not know what payment on account meant no understanding of issues unclear statements allegedly no confirmation email in the wake ;disappointed
there was no solution to my problem;disappointed
i had expected extended warranty registration in the first 3 months i could also find a source for expensive spare parts myself ;disappointed
no real support;disappointed
i would have liked from phillips recommended an alternative suggestion and not that i have to ask again i then got more info in our media market and then i was very pleasantly surprised so that i can now send the device back after media markt communicated with phillips i found that very nice again from phillips ;disappointed
procedure 60 0014171715 until today no feedback and no replacement ;disappointed
be more professional and exclude partner you are entrusted especially about the question refunds ;disappointed
you have not satisfied me;disappointed
provide the codes of the spare parts of the devices in such a way as to make them better available train the customer care operators to correctly identify these parts ;disappointed
been able to answer questions about your own products ;disappointed
last aufzrag was not registered so everything had to be re explained the situation was very difficult to understand although the facts were very simple;disappointed
give me a clue how to get my gc8220 up and running again i was told that a 10 year old device was already old enough to be disposed of i should be glad that it has lasted so long and i got a 10% coupon for a purchase from the philips online shop  sustainability is a bit different ;disappointed
further folding the order;disappointed
do not just go to plan a ;disappointed
an acceptable solution;disappointed
spare part was out of stock although bought only in 2016;disappointed
it was not really on the problem received bag and filter change which was recommended to me i had already done it myself i also wrote what else could you not recommend to me ;disappointed
i wanted to do you a favor with my well intentioned hint maybe someday even sometime would somehow complain against philips because it was not clear that the lower jaw must also be cleaned see coca cola what do i get as a first answer? please send the exact text page of the manual we can not find that i'm going to work again what do i get as a second answer? we will pass this on and explain in detail how you have to brush your teeth thank you i already know that customer friendliness looks different in my eyes perhaps more so thank you very much for purchasing our product and for working intensively with the manual here we have really made a serious mistake we will correct that immediately please stay true to our products as a thank you for your reference and your efforts we will send you a replacement brush head  think about it best regards and nice weekend;disappointed
 make spare parts available for the products you market i bought the product because i thought the philips a serious brand  unfortunately i had to change my mind  ;disappointed
reasonably listen and respond to the questions you have asked and not answer any other product this customer service is embarrassing and a joke and nothing else ;disappointed
machine was otherwise defective afterwards;disappointed
products also available individually  eg handpiece diamond clean;disappointed
be more competent and act  first listen before you tell something with half knowledge;disappointed
keep in touch answer question;disappointed
no goodwill i will not recommend philips ;disappointed
to meet the promised recall also  ;disappointed
products on which warranty must be exchanged without hesitation;disappointed
i contacted you because my pt860 didn't work anymore i wanted a new machine i bought the machine on lanzarote in march 2018 with a 2 year international warranty i was also offered to buy a new machine and get 30% off the purchase not fully accepted and accepted you should send a new machine ;disappointed
i am still waiting for the credit of the article returned by me i do not receive an answer from the customer service;disappointed
the concern was not solved ;disappointed
the customers do not pose as stupid;disappointed
return to me you asked the last e mail after my contact details which you have received but since then nothing has happened ;disappointed
first of all i would like to say in advance that their customer service is friendly and probably helpful but i would like to tell you that it is an absolute impudence not to provide spare parts for one of your products it is the lid with push button for the avent bottle warmer even when on the move scf256 00 although i have used this since 2015 but unfortunately almost never now when i fall down the lid is broken which does not speak directly of quality since your service can not deliver such a simple lid i was recommended to make a new purchase with a 20% discount but at least it still costs me too much considering i only need a new lid which is probably not worth 5  i wonder why can not just unscrew the lid of an existing set? of course this can then no longer be sold as complete but your company will certainly find a solution to write off this product in case of inventory differences and should it often be the case that you receive requests for this lid tut adding this lid to your spare parts list i will certainly not make a new purchase i prefer to throw the part away and inform myself at your competition for a new way to warm the vial i am really disappointed because i have had better experiences with medela and nuk ;disappointed
i reported about a thermo jug for babies which does not keep the water warm anymore that after a year that should not happen at all i was offered 20% on plugless avent products from this assortment i can not use anything ;disappointed
i wanted a specific item which apparently has been discontinued so the advisor suggested an alternative which was of no use whatsoever;disappointed
kulanter sein ;disappointed
don't know maybe let me return the item to the store instead of having to post to you;disappointed
exchange does not always solve the problem;disappointed
i do not know ;disappointed
although i was very friendly advice but have received the wrong content in terms of content based on this misinformation i bought a device from philips that does not meet my requirements i am very disappointed ;disappointed
for a product that is just 2 1 2 years old you should necessarily spare spare  never again philips that's planned obsolescence pure  very disappointing with the prices for razors then rather cheap goods from china which must work for two years and costs about 15% of the amazing prices of philips ;disappointed
at least something for reasons of goodwill such as a small set of brush heads etc ;disappointed
the process was not processed until today mails were answered very late apparently a mail with attachment proof of purchase does not arrive at you? mesh? telephone contacts mrs samopolo and mrs blackberry are very nice but in the further course pledges are not kept to date no positive termination is possible i just got to the 3rd once the proof of purchase sent to you and now hope that the process is finally processed ;disappointed
the iron bought in spite of having brought it to service and done the tests you said does not work continues to escape water during the steam;disappointed
reply to actual question initially asked not after several emails and offer better solution to complaint;disappointed
no reply to my mail received apparently philips vacuum cleaners are not even a normal user manual but only a funny sheet for analphabethen ;disappointed
a little more goodwill with good customers and especially with articles that do not work properly and then come from philips itself you should really get rid of things and not hide behind receipts which i have by the way was always pleasantly convinced by the customer service because uncomplicated and close to the customer unfortunately not this time but you never learn ;disappointed
more transparency about them offers in terms of repairs it does not appear that they offer a repair service for machines in the age of 5 years ;disappointed
respond to my problem and send no standard text have your product sent back because it did not work at all ;disappointed
outdated manual in my opinion the customer is left with his damages due to the faulty operating instructions additional parts according to the manual were for various reasons incomprehensible not included ;disappointed
by having better after sales service understood in such a way that you actually have the option of purchasing ordinary consumer accessories in this case toothbrush heads which you yourself recommend replacing every 3 months it is so impossible to obtain obviously? have been trying for 5 months now and am so happy that there are copy products ;disappointed
the contact person was very friendly and helpful it does not change that it is outrageous to break expensive products after such a short time and then offer to check scrap them for  35 i am happy to pay for repairs however i will not spend any money to find out if the product is even repairable knowing that manufacturers are not interested in repair my next ironing investm;disappointed
staff very nice only the proposed problem solution was not acceptable to me but where the employee could not for ;disappointed
margin;disappointed
no aftercare or loyalty towards its customers;disappointed
i haven't received the product that was promised via the customer service yet ;disappointed
dear ladies and gentlemen unfortunately there was no solution for me dhl let us wait a whole day and did not come i can not take one day off  why can not i send the device by mail? your approach is not customer oriented  who has several holidays for a broken toothbrush which has become defective in warranty i can not help it and have to sit at home for a while maybe until dhl comes that's not a solution for me i'll quickly ask for another solution ;disappointed
have not received an answer to my problem;disappointed
registration link does not work with google chrome either;disappointed
responding to my feedback on a material defect merely with understanding is pretty weak at least a replacement could have been offered ;disappointed
for branded devices i expect replacement parts too bad that this is not the case the device is otherwise in top condition now i have to dispose of it ;disappointed
give me the reimbursement that i deserve  since the mistake that has been made is not mine but one of your representatives ;disappointed
responding to my request instead of just writing it would not be possible;disappointed
i was asked 3 x same questions somewhat strange furthermore my package without delivery label or note just put in front of the door anyone could have taken that ;disappointed
to offer a real solution ;disappointed
i was very disappointed on the phone because i was knocked down in a tone that you would not expect from a customer service representative have it in retrospect tried by mail but the link was not which was sent to me ;disappointed
i expected an answer to my question i'm constantly being relayed somewhere else;disappointed
do not know who does not have black in time but i delivered a machine got new it is good but has had 2 machines now that do not work on tugging on the pitcher it blows holes in the coffee filter during tractor i had to contact el buy yourself several times for they got answers from you they said ;disappointed
we still have the problem very un helpful we don't all have skills on computers;disappointed
check my broken iron and not weaken the defect as normal ;disappointed
specify product number;disappointed
too impersonal unkulant reference from phillips switzerland to external company sertronics ag these require for overrun items overpriced compared to price comparison with philips germany ;disappointed
more advice and not a voucher for a product that can only be redeemed from 30  purchase value the article is only 13  and as a warranty case the kd has to take care of itself no concession and customer unfriendly preparation so i have not bought the item yet i'm thinking of admitting the filter mach;disappointed
after the first info which unfortunately did not help me despite a further request by mail no one reported any more although further help was promised customer service nonsmoking ;disappointed
my problem was not solved;disappointed
i ordered express delivery and paid although i got a refund for postage the product arrivex 10 days later ;disappointed
by sorting out my ongoing repair replacement which i  m sti;disappointed

could answer in writing in danish;disappointed
question was not answered ;disappointed
courtesy actions on devices that are broken after 3 years and were very expensive to buy service advisors were very good and went into everything and were very helpful ;disappointed
i'm disappointed that a 4 month old coffee maker goes down so quickly and we have to send in the machine and there is no customer service on site [in berlin] to do the repair ;disappointed
make automatically available on the site in your profile the receipts of purchases made from your site;disappointed
the conversation concerned the coffee machine senseo 3 1 which is a demonstrator in the shop guaranteed that there would be coffee pods in store from january 7 which is not true now i have to pay shipping or go to an elgiganmten to shop then i got hold of an english speaking support that sent a link to a web page where i could order coffee that solution i could probably figure out myself but the error was probably that i trusted your demonstrator at elgiganten in nordstan gothenburg feel free to comment on my case above peter hammer@rec indovent se;disappointed
individual less standard blabla;disappointed
if i buy a product that does not contain a description and the cookbook advertised on packaging then i expect to receive these books or books i do not want to get a link painted and only have to print a few pages or lie around ;disappointed
by having the item in stock or at least knowing roughly when it would be available;disappointed
you didn  t have my toothbrush in stock however your representative kindly told me several places wh;disappointed
you can provide better info regarding products ;disappointed
have until today 22 01 2019 received no response to my request my customers expect a different service ;disappointed
the gentleman of the customer service seemed annoyed had already for other things contact with the customer service which was however at that time much friendlier and helpful have indeed received my answer but as already mentioned seemed very elanlos ud annoyed ;disappointed
there are no spare parts for the vacuum cleaner ;disappointed
give a reasonable answer if you contradict yourself in your own data the answer you give is of little help but legally guaranteed not vulnerable ;disappointed
despite actually unambiguous formulation the editor did not understand the question in the beginning the answer was a slippery subject omission or probably a pre written text module and very disappointing ;disappointed
my data could not be found in your system although i had used your service money back guarantee you had emailed me the required documents and i also returned the device according to your instructions i got it over a status link information the coworker comforted me that i should announce myself again on 24 1 19 he could not explain the data loss your colleague stated that i had initiated the process online myself and it would have been better if i had ordered the case from the beginning by telephone furthermore your service provider would be responsible for the long processing time he also wanted to refer me to their service provider so i can call there myself i rejected that because it is their job to contact the service provider and to be responsible for the delay he also told me that the promised in the money back guarantee 4 6 weeks deadline would expire in three days furthermore he could not explain why my three emails have remained unanswered so far yesterday i sent the whole process again by e mail stating my number to you ;disappointed
 very slow and in addition bad service ;disappointed
to better address mistakes as there are also people who help themselves with specialist background knowledge and experience here was only pointed to a repair in your house and offered discounts for a new device ;disappointed
more on my problems;disappointed
the reference that there is no suitable spare part for a 2 years old device and i can search in the open market seems to me a bit strange also that no offer of a spare parts list or exploded view was made i think a pity ;disappointed
take my concerns seriously;disappointed
 i can not use the ultrasound machine of my sonic toothbrush because they are unable to deliver a broken bulb otherwise the burr works fine as a consolation i should receive a coupon of 10% on a new device or on toothbrushes then i save 4   where i pay less for the brushes elsewhere and then th ;disappointed
your products need urgent improvement with your strange reasons you cause further trouble;disappointed
i have bought a toothbrush have tried to register it but it says the warranty ran out on the day i bought it so went online spoke to lovely chap called dimitri who said he sorted it buut still now says warranty ran out on day i bought it v disappointed;disappointed
serve that would be enough difficult to get in touch call canceled customer said he might break and call back didn't call until now the matter has not been resolved poor asiakadpalvelu almost every time when i had connections annoyance ;disappointed
 if you already advertise the product brush head holder for sonic deacon on the website then you should also be able to buy it i think for a company as big as philips it should not be a problem to make let this product ;disappointed
has taken too long ;disappointed
would have been very nice to send the operating instructions instead of reference to the internet i had to print the operating instructions 72 pages myself ;disappointed

reply ;disappointed
i probably did not know how to explain myself well;disappointed
clarity about where to get parts and faster handling of operations;disappointed
i initially got no feedback on two contacts only when i asked by phone the matter was investigated ;disappointed
i got a preprinted response and no feedback for me personally so exited as a customer;disappointed

i did not understand  the replacement handpiece was only half a year old but now defective  then i assume that a new toothbrush does not last long  i will buy my next e toothbrush from a competitor ;disappointed

more goodwill ;disappointed
unfortunately i have not received an answer until today ;disappointed
there was no good cooperation i would have liked a better vote;disappointed
been quicker ;disappointed
 i bought a new senseo pattkaffeemaschine because the old which is also only 1 year old is too loud unfortunately i have to say that the new one from the first day is even louder than the old one that's why i asked for comments a few weeks ago now i get this poll not satisfactory ;disappointed
kulant act;disappointed
nothing to take away from the operator available and efficient for the rest i think you might have regard for your customers ;disappointed
to get in touch with my 1 mail in time to help me in the 2 mail concretely and not to refer to the provider respond to my answer to the 2nd email i had sent a recording documenting the problem ;disappointed
product knowledge not available even with copies of the manual it was not possible to get a clear precise and fast answer ;disappointed
personally i am not satisfied with the 20% voucher especially if i am at amazon and the same device bri1922 to euro 252 00 and the philips online shop for euro 369 99 since i am still cheaper on amazon ;disappointed
  we now have the fourth replacement device and more than one i'm sorry that they had trouble we have not received  ;disappointed
they can think this over for themselves ;disappointed

solve my problem voucher from the newsletter was invalid should be resent to me but never arrived alternatively it would have been nice to take the order including the reduction by the voucher simply by phone but also did not work strange concept this customer service ;disappointed
better preparation of assistance service buying a philips product and then realizing that you do not receive adequate assistance in need means losing confidence first of all in the brand;disappointed
 dear ladies and gentlemen together with my girlfriend i had bought a toothbrush set in conrad markt bremen a few years ago both toothbrushes broke more specifically both of us were awakened by bad noises at night my wife's toothbrush first had corresponding failures by the toothbrush 'philips sonicar' turning itself on then falling from the sink to the floor tiles and continuing to hum 'until the aku was empty either we were scared to death at night as well as found in the morning a battery technically 'emptied' toothbrush again we did not have to laugh tragic my wife's toothbrush went out of service a few days before the warranty expired # and she got a new toothbrush delivered promptly note the replacement brush was broken a few weeks ago and she has already received the second replacement brush for free defective again or for the second time the battery for me the service was in turn hair raising my toothbrush failed 'sudden' few days week after the expiration of the legal warranty period of 2 years i was not offered a spare brush 'kulanterweise' but i should buy a reduced toothbrush which i did not do because i can not understand when my wife and i buy a set together and a toothbrush still defect in the warranty period and the other a little time on the warranty  that a global company like philips there can not be accommodating vice versa so does also especially since the defect is known as a colorful dog and the e my wife's replacement toothbrush also fell ill on the rechargeable battery exactly the battery broke even with me or i was woken up more often at night by the toothbrush on its own and later emptied lying on the floor i should have created a youtube video and put viral 100 000 clicks would certainly have come together for us the behavior of the toothbrush as well as the customer service of their house was a very big nuisance i wonder how i can bring this case to your ceo so that the top of a company i've been a business consultant sap consultant for over 20 years understands on the one hand 'internal policies' being implemented correctly i'm not blaming your employees but on the other hand in a case where a couple has to deal with a common toothbrush at the end where this couple owns a lot of philips products hue lamps we shoot and film semi professionally that you do not even have an eye can push down what is internal requirements there is always a plan b even in the customer service of philips as everywhere in global corporations sincerely chris arnold ps my partner's name is carolin runge we both live in 67122 altrip across from mannheim in the vorderpfalz ;disappointed

the customer service is ok my disappointment is the company rule no spare parts to ship repairing instead of throwing away is a commandment of the times this is not possible without spare parts submitting and repairing is usually too expensive and therefore no alternative ;disappointed

i requested to cancel my order or have it amended as i forgot to enter a discount code i was told the order could not be stopped or altered by philips the parcel would be sent out anyway seems bizarre that a company as big as philips don  t have the technology to amend an order minute;disappointed

it proved difficult to resolve this problem as it was impossible to obtain the necessary invoice from amazon's supplier ;disappointed
the information was not understandable to me can i return a device that i have already used? i can not imagine that ;disappointed
you could have served me better if you did not charge the charger while the product is on bail also when i mentioned the problem and if the product was defective you should contact me directly and arrange the replacement instead of telling me that you have to i call in the service department to ask for his price this is not customer service ;disappointed
their efforts to solve a problem were totally inadequate;disappointed

this is not about the person i spoke to it is about your electric toothbrush they work fine until they get dropped or after a while they should be more solid and last longer than 2 years which is my experience of your brushes you should be able to boast a minimum 5 years product warranty when you pay such a high price ;disappointed

when i asked how many bailers are installed in the wheel of the hu593010 i got no answer from philips ;disappointed

i registered my product with philips and they promised a warranty extension on registration however that probably did not work ;disappointed
the person that i spoke to could not have been more helpful but when i purchase a product with the philips name i expect a far better service than i received overall the fact that i was unable to purchase replacement parts for my phillips senseo coffee machine was a great disappointment the gentleman explained to me that this product is no longer sold in the uk and that no spares were available i am absolutely dismayed by this and i feel that i will no longer purchase a phillips product i am sure that if you look at your records you will see that the coffee machine is not the only product that i have purchased from your company but this experience has questioned your customer service??;disappointed
you would not have had me wait over 2 weeks for an answer because of the razor from another company i would have guaranteed a new razor on goodwill ;disappointed

content more flexibility;disappointed
faster and detailed information about my question;disappointed
improve the products or at least reduce the exaggerated prices for the quality offered;disappointed
given the nature of the problem i would have thought you would want to know why it is happening so that you put measures in place to prevent its reoccurrence ;disappointed
offer concrete compensation to the inconvenience of the consumer  it is not enough to say you can refer to a service center proven after 3 substitutions for the same defect ;disappointed
the problem was not answered at all knowing answers i felt like i was advise more than a machine needs to be descaled regularly i do that with all devices ;disappointed
a little more info would have been nice why the part has to be replaced ;disappointed

the information was unsatisfactory the filters which supposedly do not exist yet can be bought at mediamarkt ;disappointed
respond faster i asked a very simple question and waited days for the answer and in this answer a wrong link was deposited very disappointing for this reason i have currently decided against the purchase of the philips aqua trio ;disappointed

i called regarding a sonic toothbrush handle that has been replaced 4 times during my guarantee and it had always been replaced the lady i spoke too said the warranty has expired even though the toothbrush handle needed replacing due to a fault every 18 months she said the warranty only starts from purchase not from when it was replaced i think this is very poor customer service and i won  t be buying anot;disappointed
every time i wanted to follow up on the case i had to start a chat and thus a new case because there were no responses to emails even though it is definitely in them that if you have additional information or questions you just have to answer the email i am disappointed that as i thought there was another 1 year warranty on the coffee machine registration i certainly thought that could be remembered but couldn't prove it on the other hand it was so good to get a discount voucher of 40% ;disappointed

suggest a solution or if one is not found forward the information to the product development as a development proposal to find a solution for a beautiful day or improve the product;disappointed
let's see if a 30  part worth it to scar;disappointed

my main concern was not having the part which was vital for my product to work although i have been told this part will be ordered in 10 15 working days i do not think this is good enough there was no effort to compensate me for my loss and i did not feel the person i spoke to sounded apologetic for the unusable device i had paid for ;disappointed
employee very nice but unfortunately i did not get a spare part;disappointed
 even with a supposedly only cosmetic defect i would have wished for a 3 week old device remedy ;disappointed

 we phoned customer service because we were not sure whether or not we had bought a model that was for use in the uk the plug supplied on the charger was not a uk plug the person we spoke to was very pleasant but instead of simply saying to us you need to get a european plug adaptor for use in the uk she went into a complex spiel which promised to be exhausting rather than helpful we concluded the conversation searched through our belongings and found a european adaptor and now hope that is was a correct decision the toothbrush seems to work 

we were rather frustrated that philips has nothing on the box to indicate that an adaptor plug is necessary for uk use ;disappointed

the one i chatted with was very helpful but since the information you have and the customer service has access to is substandard unfortunately the service experience is poor make sure to update your web pages about resellers or is it that you are leaving the market ??? in any case that experience i got after trying to get hold of spare parts both in spain and in sweden ;disappointed

by not supplying products with batteries that systematically fail after a short period of time;disappointed
the answers always lasted for a very long time and resulted in more and more inconsequential questions that ultimately resulted in the return of the device i am now buying a venta device pity;disappointed
you could hire some competent software writers to rewrite the healthcare app ;disappointed
resolved the problem;disappointed
consumable accessories vacuum cleaner filter should not have an estimated delivery time of over a year ;disappointed
to offer the product;disappointed
provide the correct spare part the closure of the milk container was delivered instead of the defective water tank as stated ;disappointed
processing time of 4 weeks was much too long;disappointed
hire and train customer oriented employees and no screen copiers ;disappointed
maybe the customer advisors should not put the customers down as stupid ;disappointed
just made it simple and replaced the cracked blender housing under warranty who saves receipts for products this long?;disappointed
the nice lady was very helpful unfortunately the spare part was still in stock and the recommended dealer did not contact us until 1 week later we asked for media markt and the part for free receive this is real service ;disappointed
produce quality products it is a joke that keeps the philips sonicare of the battery only less than 1 year and then the toothbrush must be disposed of ;disappointed
better coordinate with the fetching was disastrous waited for a complete day for free pickup;disappointed
an info with content on the asked question ;disappointed
actually you buy a branded device because it is assumed that this spare parts are available unfortunately none you have to acquire a complete functional unit cleanstation but even that is not available at philips one is referred to an external service partner who sends the overpriced device only against payment in advance  and thus obviously also leaves time device not yet arrived as you can hear similar experiences with stationary retailers all 9000 series heaters have been lagging behind for months now you get the impression that the razor arm should not be pursued any more it's a pity because the herds are actually good the chat partner was very helpful and helpful ;disappointed
we have not seen any money from the exchange action yet it's been forever ;disappointed
the word is customer service offering a link to your own shipping was weak an explanation of why the one toothbrush with the plug is and not the second would have been more logical simply sending the plug i would have felt as a real service ;disappointed
i have brought so many products from philips the item concerned diamond clean sonicare toothbrush had already been replaced by philips because it was faulty the replacement was also faulty and i was told because the original one has passed the guarantee replacement date there was nothing that could be done even though the replacement would not have been out of a guarantee date this seems very wrong to me ;disappointed
responding to questions and concerns of your customers instead of always bringing the same phrases;disappointed
  the problem was not solved in the end ;disappointed
the product will replace it;disappointed
it took more than a month to get my case replaced faster and less complicated action by customer service would have been great or i had to ask again and again what it looks like now ;disappointed
since there is no gift today i can not give a recommendation either;disappointed
 i approached your service for a blunder on the sonicare diamondclean brush heads due to an obvious product defect however since i could not show the purchase i was then dealt with a miserable 10% discount voucher that's not how we imagine service as long time customers and users of the sonicare diamondclean we were stunned by the way but visibly unfortunately we now have to think about switching to a competitor already regrettable as we have always been satisfied until now ;disappointed
responding to my request for spare parts at all ;disappointed
address the problem and read the questions correctly not always standard answers  ;disappointed
i never got a response to solve my problem;disappointed
the information was disappointing because i was not given any information about the battery only that a li ion battery is installed the voltage value 3 7v which was important was missing i have received this information from another source ;disappointed
not make promises you can  t keep horrendous customer service ;disappointed
more goodwill after 2 5 years the coffee machine is defective no answer was given to my question as they are not allowed to do so i should send in the device and pay 150 euros for the repair or the cost estimate for a device that cost 250 euros this is unprofitable ;disappointed
i bought the device a little more than 2 years ago and now things are already breaking and i should pay for the spare part too it is not a wear part  i'm really mad at philips that was the last vacuum cleaner of yours ;disappointed
the simple replacement line is very easy to send and ready ;disappointed

send a confirmation email for a warranty extension of 3 years contrary to your statement i have already registered my device ;disappointed
unfortunately the employee had no answer to my request instead he talked about the bush here i would wish for the future that one says honestly that one does not know the answer and then one flutacht for the customer i do that in my work too if i can not deliver the answer to the customer and there is no colleague nearby who can help me ;disappointed
the repair was poor customer service although friendly but not satisfactory ;disappointed
just answer my emails requests that would have helped ;disappointed
report as promised ;disappointed
listened better o seen better in pictures i submitted you sent the wrong product tear plate in the wrong size then you offered one of each tear plate size which may seem nice hope they come but then we will have three whole discs in the size that have not yet broken but only one disc of the finer disc that we initially advertised would rather have the opposite ;disappointed
a goodwill solution;disappointed
bring back the compact brush heads;disappointed
no goodwill no accommodation just a pity next time i buy a product from the competition;disappointed
call as agreed;disappointed
if the guarantee time tuch my unfortunately delayed responding only a few days not even a week was exceeded and i barely had the product in use and then it does not work it should not happen that a large corporation with a rejection  that should not be necessary for philips ;disappointed
contacted me at arranged times;disappointed
my very specific question about the sonicare toothbrushes has been referred to your entire range i could already see that on your pages and found it quite blazing and under categorized even your product advisor did not help me partly because products came out that they currently have not on offer i would like to thank your co worker for offering you a 10% voucher as a decision making aid;disappointed
my problem would not be solved there was no direct answer to my question ;disappointed
i was advised to buy the broken piece glass to load the sonicare on the philips online shop but it is no longer available online ;disappointed
deliver was poor;disappointed
faster help this case has begun to take over 1 year to complete if you as a customer call for a defect in a purchased product there really should be no difficulty in just sending a new one instead it would be pulled out and we felt distrusted ;disappointed
there was no feedback from philips ;disappointed
my device was damaged during the repair this is very annoying ;disappointed
swedish speaking recipient;disappointed
provide a sensible approach and not completely redundant ;disappointed
send the contest gift;disappointed
do not raise hopes meet quality requirements of the customer ;disappointed
the excellent part was that you offered a replacement to my faulty product but not one of equal value and as the iron was still within warranty i was unhappy to accept the lower value iron i exchanged it like for like at john lewis without any issues ;disappointed
do not answer by quoting the instruction manual read my emails correctly and also answer my questions and not talk around it witnessing with expertise definitely not the case ;disappointed

better useful for me answers to how electricity i can repair my product broken toothbrush such an expensive product i think will last longer than two years everything should be possible to repair i was getting ready to buy a new one with very little discount it must be possible to get an order for a start button that is stuck how difficult it can be to cook i mean ;disappointed
 in order to clarify the matter 4 different contacts were needed from the customer side yet you did not have any other solution than buy a new store online to get a discount voucher from us ;disappointed
maybe without great theater to replace the defective parts and thus easily solve the problem ;disappointed
i didnt receive the product for over a month i had to contact you three times before any one even came back to me ;disappointed
very customer unfriendly never again philips entering on customer argument would have been nice because of 16 eur ;disappointed
refunds should be made within three working days from the day the returrn is received by philips not 10 working days ;disappointed
better training of employees not competent;disappointed
it's an impudence that the toothbrush turns yellow and looks unhygienic and philips says it does not affect its functionality it's finally about a hygiene product i had everything from philips including razors beard trimmers etc but that was it for me the employee expressly can not help it ;disappointed
to respond to customers;disappointed
your product is obviously technically unreliable you needed to take that into account ;disappointed
it is strange to have a warranty on a brand new device;disappointed

long wait for any answer ;disappointed
 the customer service was very friendly and went out of his way but completely ignorant i had to look up everything in the computer or ask for it and then like me i still did not understand it a media markt employee could help me more that's sad ;disappointed
just to give customers a feeling that they are important;disappointed
offering the right charging cable in the online shop would be cool ;disappointed

the gentleman was very friendly and helpful unfortunately could not help because ups carries the blame i'm really surprised that philips works with this company ;disappointed
i was promised that they will let me know how to proceed only after demand someone has reported;disappointed
deal with your warranty faster with your dealer i could use the device for 4 days after which it has been in service for 1 month ;disappointed
do what is promised;disappointed
one would have to work on the complication one says it is sufficient then the other one writes the next again so and in the end the broken part has not been refunded i can not recommend philips and we immediately switched to another product too bad that this machine has only lasted 2 months;disappointed
recommend the right product;disappointed

i've been using philips sonicare from the time they were launched and bought from the ideal home exhibition 25+ years ago? ive had probably about 5 myself bought 2 for my husband and now my daughter has one i've also influenced so many people to buy them including dentists and on my own social platforms i was disappointed that when i quite reasonably could not find receipt but did find all the books that it comes with and sent photo's that you only offered 25% discount that is a level that i could get in pretty much any retailer you supply you are not paying their margin when i buy direct from you either i think when i spend over  200 on a toothbrush plus hundreds on toothbrush heads it should last well clearly the spindle was faulty i was disappointed did not feel valued even though the person at your office was quite polite it wasn't his fault and since you are between 3 10 times higher cost than your competitors i thought it was time to try another brand sad thing is e you lose at least 3 people and potentially many more i think if you were not prepare to replace then you should have offered at least 50% off as a minimum which still leaves you more profitable than when you supply retailers like boots you have followed up with me twice now on this matter and there is a lesson to be learnt look after the customers you already have because it is much more expensive to recruit new customers don't make it so easy for existing customers to walk away from being loyal to you because once they try another brand they may never come back and don't forget we do talk to our friends family and in my case social audience and next time i could be recommending a competitor product and not yours ;disappointed
by repairing my iron;disappointed
you as a manufacturer should have spare parts and not another company you continue to sell them and then a small kettle sieve costs just 15 chf plus almost 14 fee that's just disappointing ;disappointed

there was no goodwill but only 20% discount on a new purchase but only in their online store that would have been the hair clipper still more expensive than on amazon ;disappointed

nowadays it is common the need of repairing or maintenance for electronic devices it's easier when you can just bring your appliance or device to a service point and they let you know when the repairing has been performed i have experienced other maintenance services from retailers like 'media mkt' and 'elgiganten' where you can bring your device to the service point philips customer service was a lot more tricky when it forces me to go through the customer service via webpage and after asking me a lot of things then they allow me to send the product for maintenance service which has to be performed by myself meaning i need to post it via dhl ;disappointed

you could have exchnaged the faulty product instead of giving me a discount off my next purchase which was useless as it was still more expensive than buying elsewhere ;disappointed
to inquire in advance do not let the customer do the job with a clear mistake from philips ;disappointed
terrible outcome on a product that cost me over  150 and it is not working and there are no options for a replacment dreadful product and customer ;disappointed

 service basically fine but i bought my series5000 shaver on 28 feb 2018 and have been very pleased with it until in started getting a high pitched whining noise from the heads when shaving i spoke to your helpful customer service team but was horrified to be told that as i used it every day the heads would not last for the 2yr warranty period and not even 1 year 
sorry this is riduculous i have used philips shavers for the past 60yrs and this is probably my 15th philips shaver and have shaved every day like everybody else did until the beard fashion took over i have ordered and paid for a further set of heads see ref 5002x00001zsheh but i can't come to terms with this comment that they are not designed to be used every day 
please explain that's why my survey is not what i would have wished 
please ensure that this report is passed to senior management to process 

roger fishwick email randh fishwick@btinternet com 13 feb 2019 ;disappointed
to offer me a similar product in the complaint;disappointed
a timely feedback would be recommended answers will come if any after several weeks after my last contact i have been waiting for more than 5 weeks for feedback but at least send me no feedback after 5 weeks but a poll very serious  ;disappointed
the duration of the answers is too long that has to go faster the waiting time for my product takes much too long;disappointed
i was given a 20% discount on prices that are double what i can buy these products for on other websites having spent 350chf on products that failed shortly after warranty expired i would have hoped for a better solution;disappointed
answer my question ;disappointed
it was not the fault of the telephone operators but after going to your authorized service center they try to solve the problem to no avail fortunately amazon made me a free replacement;disappointed
our company has ordered a larger amount in your home your employees have misconstrued the bill and were unwilling to correct it we had no input tax deduction ;disappointed
answer my question ;disappointed
good support guy but the techniques he contacted with my questions took very long time to answer many weeks and when the answer came it was a non response they did not respond specifically to my question but came up with a blemished answer this concerned pfass in kitchen appliances of the diffuse responses to judging there are machines but the technicians do not want to say that since they understand that i would refrain from buying total ig in grades for the technology department who could not deliver either a reasonable response or answers to my questions ;disappointed
more on the customer request but this is only possible if you use expert staff my valid warranty extension was not recognized and rejected on flimsy grounds instead i was then offered a coupon over 20% for the purchase of the spare part luckily i have a legal protection insurance covering everything it's just a pity that i have to take this because of a spare part worth 15  the purchase of other products from philips is exclud;disappointed
ensured that the promised trial package was valued at a value now we might get it if it comes in stock ;disappointed
philips did not have a spare part so i got a discount code for the online store the only thing is that after the discount the product costs the same as a local dealer ;disappointed
inform yourself about the product i had the impression i could have talked to my interlocutor about an egg cooker unfortunately no expertise was available call 3 and 3 different people ;disappointed
delivery was wrong and i'm waiting for the return of upd;disappointed
i asked for a service manual for a device worth about 100 eur and i didn't get it it is worth not to take a device worthy of maintenance maybe it's easier to switch the device when it finally breaks down and at the same time the manufacturer ;disappointed
more customer service make the customer feel valued and create sustainable products;disappointed
answer my question;disappointed
callbacks forwarding concerns not only put customers off guard and offer a more than bad solution to complaints buy no more philips product so fast ;disappointed
build a better shaver it was like shaving with some sort of cheap chinese copy shaver absolute rubbish;disappointed
give correct information give clear information give uniform information enable uncomplicated service ;disappointed
produce better products;disappointed
inform me beforehand that this product is no longer available ;disappointed
there was no satisfactory answer the coworker seemed less competent and had trouble understanding my request at all ;disappointed
you could have procured a spare part;disappointed
it's a complicated and lengthy process the handler was not up to date on the campaign but it was clear and finally managed ;disappointed
to sell the razor in complete equipment ie a travel case in which the razor fits with the charger and a protective cap for the shaving head i expected this equipment as minnimum since i have not received any answer to my communication to you about www philips de cw suppert home suppert conttakt form  until today i do not expect a reaction to the message only my call over 040808010980 brought only a pity statement or respectively the indication that i can buy the protective cap under customer friendliness i understand something else ;disappointed
the intercom battery i have for the baby should be sold or even available from philips rather than being manufactured something that takes a few days and the monitor is necessary ;disappointed
the price difference between germany and austria too big;disappointed
also provide replacement charge on warranty order with discount by apple iphone not possible ;disappointed
clear answer i expected to be helped further;disappointed
there was no answer anymore and no productive solution of the obviously defective pot since buying ;disappointed
the solution of the problem;disappointed
my question was not answered;disappointed
showing a response to my request would have been a start so far i only got one generated emai that someone will contact me how should i rate the customer service if there was no service i'm just feeling a little bit puzzled  ;disappointed
repeatedly asked for feedback because i have reached anyone at the specified e mail address never get one tried 3 times;disappointed
responding to my request and not copying a message and then forgetting to delete the name from the copied message ;disappointed
treat yourself to your products if they have a problem and have trouble servicing the customer to find a solution i have been left without the mourning one and a half months without losing myself but you have the money i still do not have a new affair so i do not know anything else ;disappointed
actually responded to my enquiry and be helpful;disappointed
it was not at all my concern ;disappointed
 first it would have been nice if someone had read my question at all then i could have saved me another mail and the answer send to philips is you have no more guarantee super i would have guaranteed if the thing was already with you note 6 ;disappointed
the representative of serres has not repaired a month ago i would like to have it sent for repair in the central area;disappointed
the customer service representative was very friendly but the goodwill was very disappointing so i can not recommend the sonicare in our dentist practice due to the lack of brush attachments pity ;disappointed
a name more dedication and much more have a company myself and the customer is still king do not pretend that ;disappointed
i would have liked answers about design choices made by the company ;disappointed
my question could not be answered;disappointed
my problem as in the past under telephone instructions to solve the same and not via an e mail that was announced as a video ;disappointed
i contacted the customer service after the opening of a gift package containing one of your electric razors unfortunately the razor was bought in sicily but unpacked in emilia romagna inside the package missing the supplied combs spacers i would have expected a multinational like a philips to be sent to me for free but i was told that since the razor was purchased from a retailer i would have to go directly to the retailer  imagine how cheap it is to go to sicily to claim the combs  so i decided to put the razor in disuse and buy one from a competing company hoping that their customer care is more satisfactory;disappointed
answer my question ;disappointed
i did not receive any feedback at all neither where i get replacement brushes for my ultrasonic toothbrush yet which replacement brushes are suitable;disappointed
i never got an answer just this questionnaire ;disappointed
i expect that even philips can tell the buyer whether the sonicare with 62 000 vibrations in children can be used or not the answer to ask me to the dentist i think so well but i expect philips that you know this after all you also have very detailed information on all sonicare products ;disappointed
to improve your service;disappointed
i had asked for the number of charge cycles of the battery the answer to that remained vague nothing concrete i would have expected that on this topic empirical values or performed tests with results would be presented unfortunately fail ;disappointed
a better solution to the problem has now bought me a braun razor ;disappointed
to help me with a replacement product;disappointed
they simply would have accepted at my request that i wanted to send the device back and send me a returns slip on the box was written that i could send the device back within 4 weeks on the philips side i could not do anything maybe you could do something there otherwise i would be very dissatisfied kind regards;disappointed
be more aware of your products and offer real solutions;disappointed
offer help rather than throw away;disappointed
tell me that it does not work with mobile internet if you want to order something is mist ;disappointed
to replace the shaver for me would have been great as the shaver just stop working i had to buy another shaver as i didnt have anything alse to shave with at the time ;disappointed
you could have tried to fix both toothbrushes;disappointed
no one got back to me i was told to send images of the item to replaced having done so i still haven ;disappointed
 i would like to have just bought a new toothbrush individually for my charging glass since this is not supposed to be possible i have to buy everything again with the result that i then have two charging station and not to mention the expenses would be nice if you would work on your sevice something else  m f g ;disappointed
unfortunately my questions were not answered ;disappointed
i find it very unsatisfactory if you can order for a kettle of a brand manufacturer no seal as a spare part now i have to throw this kettle because of a spare part for about 20 cents this alone is unsatisfactory from an environmental point of view even the coupon over 10% can not satisfy me ;disappointed
direct help and do not refer to another email address have received no response from the customer service until today never again philips devices that is certain  ;disappointed
the product i tried to order was out of stock ?? no nothing in it the thing became clear about your answer i was expecting the message to contain the millon ko the product is back in stock i also expected that my order would remain in force when i received a query that i still want the product n;disappointed
do not make empty promises if a 10% coupon is promised via email on the phone it should also arrive it apparently only served to quickly ablate me ;disappointed
to help us ;disappointed
customer should be the forefront of the company if a customer like so much about your product and if you turn the customer down by not providing service it  s not good for your reputation and you loose a good customer i feel that my issue has n;disappointed
solve problems;disappointed
did not get spare part for my philips lumia virtually all machines have spare parts ;disappointed
unfortunately it is not possible to get this water tank for the very expensive ironing station as a spare part i can not understand that because of a plastic spare part i have to dispose of a whole ironing station for around chf 2'000 which still works perfectly this also contradicts all of today's efforts to protect our climate since i am now forced to buy a new station i will probably buy this at miele incidentally the philips employee was very friendly and regretted that he could not help me where exactly the button is i could not find out unfortunately ;disappointed
good service but very disappointing with your product;disappointed
no solution on second e mail no answer very disappointed ;disappointed
to be honest ;disappointed
by still having all spares available rather than just some the motor has a 15 year warranty so it would seem reasonable to maintain a supply of spares for sometime the real disappointment was in the alternative unit that was offered a very poor substitute ;disappointed
customer service also perform;disappointed
staff are fantastic tec support slow parts department horrific;disappointed
the contact with your service was very friendly and pleasant however the answer of your service provider which was forwarded to me was not credible and ultimately unhelpful ;disappointed
disappointed with having to discard a fully functioning machine due to a small plastic knob however i myself have by chance discovered that when loaning philips hr2831 the cutting disc suited my machine found spare part online cutting disc with article number 4203 065 61950 which should fit my machine ;disappointed
give goodwill as the defect only occurred 2 weeks after the 2 year warranty ;disappointed
when i received a very unprofessional response to my email request to return a product with no sender or misspelling i contacted customer service the lady was very nice but did not know how the return policy in switzerland are and had to constantly check in addition i am irritated that products from which i have the receipt but no longer the original packaging can not send back although the deadline is within the 90 days after all one does not assume that one is dissatisfied with the product ;disappointed
i would have hoped for more goodwill because it is small parts that can break quickly and you can not buy separately;disappointed
to be able to name when and where coffee machine demonstrations take place ;disappointed
in english thanks ;disappointed
given a refund when said not a replacement had to phone up about 6 times to get the refund;disappointed
 more to meet the needs avoid waste longer spare parts warranty your approach is just without words thumb down ;disappointed
 the handle of the vacuum cleaner has a structural design error and i think the handle cannot be considered a current part making a handle will cost philips a few euros if it is and the vacuum cleaner is more than 200  for the customer so it would be reasonable for premium brand philips to receive that few euros and be satisfied with the customer as a result of this case i will never again ;disappointed
 the only problem with a perfectly good razor was that the rechargeable battery had failed it ought to be a part that can be easily replaced or repaired and the fact that it could not be suggests a rather old fashioned attitude of planned obsolescence roll on the repairability directive from the eu ;disappointed
i have a perfectly good electric whisk mixer that is now useless for the want of a pair of blades that are no longer available universal spare parts would be useful;disappointed
kulant to be in reclamation;disappointed
to produce better quality of the blades and attachments i have broken 2x blades and 2x essays of level 2 within the warranty i had bought a oneblade twin pack because i wanted to have a branded product your service clerk sent me 1 blade as compensation unfortunately i got on requests no more blade or essay ;disappointed
nothing;disappointed
disappointing that you only get parts through third party and not at the manufacturer;disappointed
the complaint was mishandled from start to finish assurances were given that simply weren't seen through i had to make multiple telephone calls to resolve my complaint regarding an item that was significantly less than a year old to be perfectly honest from such a well known company the service was shambolic i'm not really surprised it has taken over 3 months for this survey to come through either and it reinforces my opinion ;disappointed
not enough work ;disappointed
followed through with your returns procedure as stated;disappointed
you have not completed the case last contact january 28 when i sent you information philips support 60 0014480636 [ref _00dw0cp29 _5002x2m2wmy ref];disappointed
 having previously had an exchange for a previous unit i requested a full refund but felt pressurised by the customer centre to take another unit and was told we had to move things forward  i reluctantly agreed to this but this unit has again failed and i decided to put this down to a bad purchase choice and experience ;disappointed
the employee did not try to proactively solve my problem just hoping he would get rid of me quickly there was no initiative to really want to help ;disappointed
despite very polite and patient service by christina and vasili i was very disappointed that phillips were unable to supply the replacement part i requested it is a first class trimmer which will now have to be thrown away for the sake of a  6 p;disappointed
 when repairing a coffee machine the electric cord was not returned our complaint was elaborately and frankly very annoying with frequent mail ping pong edited that should be wg an electric cable also not in your sense ;disappointed
deal with my problem to my satisfaction;disappointed
it took three telephone calls to finally agree to replace my philips sonicare toothbrush and no one replied to my email and it was the second time in my 2 year warranty that i had to have the toothbrush replaced so it doesn't give me confidence in the replacement toothbrush ;disappointed
the customer service was very friendly but he did not solve my problem ;disappointed
disappointed with the product sent it back twice now and problem still persists i would like a refund ;disappointed
helped me with spare part i offered to buy it but you would rather sell me a new device ;disappointed
correction information should have been given on how to return a faulty product;disappointed
more on the problem i wanted to know the difference between sh90 50 60 70 and got only the answer old and unavailable and not suitable for my model although all are for the 9000 series  define terms eg shaving head unit  to prevent misunderstandings tips on offers such as the new customer bonus;disappointed
it was nice that i got a new toothbrush holder but i must have brushes that fit it the problem was that my toothbrush was destroyed by the new brushes i bought they ordered i on el purchases and were the right brushes ordered from philips so to put it another time my toothbrush was okay until i got the new brush that didn't actually fit and they ruined the engine on the toothbrush i dare not use the new toothbrush you sent me before sending the right brushes this case i have been doing for 2 5 months now hope you send brushes that fit so i can use it safely without more problems mvh vigdis o solberg wants answers by mail ;disappointed
by completing the action that you stated you would do over 3 months ago instead i am stuck with a razor that can ;disappointed
poor quality electric toothbrushes two of them have ben exchanged in a few months time both have different power;disappointed
customer service from philips is miserable;disappointed
i explained what the problem was ie the toothbrush wouldn  t recharge i knew it wasn  t the recharger that was at fault because the toothbrush wouldn  t recharge in the pink carrying case either i thought i was getting a replacement toothbrush but i got a recharger i had to contact phillips again and go over everything a second time then i was sent a toothbrush i know the rechwasvthe cheaper option but it was a waste of time sending it the original one works perfectly with the new toothbrush i was very pleased to eventually receive the replacement toothbrush though as i thought philips were trying to ;disappointed
kulanter compared to longtime customers ;disappointed
replied to my last few emails re the charger cable;disappointed
second sonic toothbrush i have had to send back;disappointed
by not requiring a near impossible photo of the bottom of the shiny rose gold toothbrush holder with a clear view of the serial number a speedier resolution to my problem could easily have been made as i had registered the toothbrush online with philips directly after purchase ;disappointed
the conversation consisted of asking mostly irrelevant questions about where i bought it with long gaps in between was he on several calls at once? i was asked to upload a photo of the product when i returned from doing that to find out where to upload it the call had been 'terminated' my agenda was to seek advice on how it could be fixed i didn't feel that was philips' agenda though;disappointed
sent a new spare part if the guarantee expired a few months ago i just think that one can be flexible especially as it usually takes half a year from the time the product breaks down until you get to contact support;disappointed
pretty much everything still can not register anything;disappointed
it is disappointing that there is no end user service manual for the turbo brush in the meantime i have opened and cleaned these myself i noticed that the timing belt was blocked by cat hair this does not fit my idea of an animal vacuum cleaner because the timing belt should be encapsulated so that he can not enforce ;disappointed
purchased steam iron broken after a week brought help center toast from a half month still nothing thank you have a nice day;disappointed
ask more exactly what the customer's problem is;disappointed
being more understanding from the consumer's point of view especially if philips wants the consumer to continue to buy philips products ;disappointed
 it did not seem complicated to show me how to order the spare part you asked me the cell phone number to contact me if the line fell  but who do you want to make fun of? ;disappointed
please also contact us in english;disappointed
more goodwill;disappointed
the device was removed from the program a repair offer was not made ;disappointed
respond promptly;disappointed
show goodwill;disappointed
help me to find the part i wanted;disappointed
the device had been used twice and already broken it was their product and just because the warranty was no longer available you could offer me another option for example repair ;disappointed
better to respond to my question have more technical idea of the products respond to my feedback suggest a solution ultimately i helped myself by installing missing parts that i ordered on ebay at my expense disappointing ;disappointed
everything after the first phone call to date no new machine received all vouchers expire ;disappointed
my problem was not solved the contact points that were communicated to me through the support were contacted by me a response i did not get the repair service center is not authorized to sell parts to customers ;disappointed
the customer service was very helpful unfortunately your company does the madness of our throwaway society you are forced to throw away flawlessly functioning items instead of offering the opportunity to exchange truly broken items individually that's really a pity the philips group could position itself as a pioneer in environmental protection and be a role model for others ;disappointed
answered my query properly i feel i was wasting my time ;disappointed
generic answer only which did not answer specific question;disappointed
promised feedback from 4 people never received in live chat please only reliable statements ;disappointed
have not received a reply asked about instruction book and recipe booklet in norwegian ;disappointed
from customer service i expect a little more information than the ones that i can read in the instructions for use or correct the error from the manual ;disappointed
i was promised an email with a discount voucher for the philips online store but none has been received not even in spam ;disappointed
recipes for dansk danish english so you can make full use of the xxl machine;disappointed
the price quoted was ridiculously high it was just more cost effective to buy a new one ;disappointed
no spare parts found although vacuum cleaner is only 3 years old employees were overwhelmed ;disappointed
 say that one of the keys of your company is customer satisfaction i believe that following a mistake of redirecting the internet page at the time of payment that has taken away a discount code entered it is appropriate to make a refund of the amount spent more i do not think that an answer like i'm sorry but now the article was purchased is a response to a company like philips you are the only company that does not allow refunds the only alternative proposed was refuse the package and redo the order ;disappointed
other options in how to fix my appliance;disappointed
in case of a defect 2 weeks after the expiry of the warranty period i would have expected from a brand like philips some goodwill;disappointed
deepen the motivation of the product malfunction;disappointed
reply faster to emails but i will continue to buy the vs products because they are fantastic;disappointed
to my problem i had to call the customer service because he has not despite the order not reported the customer service man was very nice he could not help me because his powers did not go far enough that did not help me ;disappointed
i have given the wrong kaffeemaschiene because of a zahledrehers in the first task of my repair order this is in spite of photo proof of the defective part and sending the bill on which the right model name is clearly visible get the wrong spare part and although that wrong by me specified model in germany at my purchase date was no longer available on another request i was told that you will not send me a new spare part since i am more than dissatisfied with this support process i will no longer buy new philips products from now on this applies to both electrical appliances kitchen appliances as well as the senseo coffee pods i have used daily at work good day colin wagner;disappointed

you could have fixed my iron as it is still leaking and i did not appreciate your comments about the way i use my iron;disappointed
the ma in the kd service acts only according to the company's specifications i am looking for a philips hx9340 handpiece and i am not interested in buying a new set that is environmentally friendly this will not bring philips alone on the market that's why i recommend the philips brand for reasons of sustainability dubious marketing strategies etc that i got a coupon over as much as 10% received this product but only sold in a complete set and then even at least 10% expensive than in normal trade the whole crowning philips 6 = set and do homework;disappointed
listen with understanding the problems without being sarcastic if something is not wrong with a product i would not be making contact ;disappointed
to better understand customer requests do not evade with evasive answers you do not always have bullying customers in front of you ;disappointed
to find customer friendly solutions on customer requests or wishes problems ;disappointed
stand for the product and its errors offer replacement or repair whether proof of purchase exists or not remains a philips device ;disappointed
there was no response after it was determined that the warranty had expired;disappointed
unfortunately my question was not answered i suspect the question was not read correctly and then a flat rate answer was sent which could fit in about the topic here it would be desirable if the described facts are taken into account and no other fact is made of it ;disappointed
a;disappointed
i could not find a solution on your website so improvised a solution i inspected the razor and concluded that it was caused by precipitation of water chalk clogging the blades i resolved the problem by soaking the cutters and heads in vinager ;disappointed
for the first time i ordered razor accessories in the philips online store 16 02 2019 but unfortunately i did not receive an order confirmation by e mail i asked for this e mail to be submitted later which is really no great art unfortunately at first i only got a deviant answer that you could not send that personally no problem i did not expect that either but it should be quite possible for a global corporation to simply forward such a request to the responsible office and arrange for the sending of a simple order confirmation e mail to mwiediger@arcor de i was also promised that unfortunately the e mail did not come to this day that's 4 days ago by the way the philips email requesting verification of my email address arrived instantly the link was clicked to confirm the e mail with the corresponding confirmation of the paypal payment also arrived order no 24005405600 00 but that's not what i ordered my mailbox works in spam nothing landed i checked several times please send now the order confirmation e mail with the list of the ordered articles which i always need for documentation reasons thank you in advance for a now immediate subsequent completion ;disappointed
i had the impression that my request was not understood correctly it was about a flawed article and it was important to me that this information be passed on to the development instead the client advisor has been constantly talking about compensation which i did not even receive in the end ;disappointed
seller in fa power misinformed us about what came with the purchase of the coffee machine we consider it fup we do not want to shop at power anymore ;disappointed
the service rep was polite and i imagine only following instructions set out by philips the product a steam generator iron was accepted as being faulty i had it for only six months it was still under warranty in immaculate condition and i had proof of purchase however the only option offered to me from philips was to have the iron collected repaired and returned to me in 14 days with no replacement iron left in the meantime although i believe i should have been offered a new iron not a repair given the short time i had used it i would have been happy to accept the repair had it not meant being without an iron for 14 days i pointed this out to the service rep but i was informed it was not possible to have a replacement in the meantime and my only other option was to speak to the retailer and ask them as a gesture of goodwill if they would replace the iron with a new one if available or supply an alternative however this would be purely at their discretion as philips would not offer any further support therefore i feel your policy is very one sided to the benefit of philips alone as either i had to be further inconvenienced and be without an iron for two weeks or the retailer had to replace the product from their stock as a gesture of good will therefore this is the reason i will not be purchasing a philips product again nor will i be recommending anyone to do so ;disappointed
first contacted customer services in sept 2018 since then i have spoken to various advisors and finally maria resolved my issue in jan 2019 maria was professional and very supportive she is an excellent advisor and would like to thank her very much ;disappointed

is it so hard to offer an essay in the accessories so you can reorder it if necessary and not an extra one of my complete razor ?? there are extra two different essays here so where is the problem to buy this individually;disappointed
recall did not take place initiative went from me ;disappointed
help me find a replacement for my razor;disappointed
the offered article was not sufficiently described it did not indicate with any line that it was a bikini set since i did not want this essay because i already have it i sat down in relation to an exchange with your customer service in connection 06 02 2019 mr jan simonis he explained to me that the article i wanted was not in stock for you and sent me a link where i get this part he also told me that i should not send back the delivered item i would get the amount i paid from you this refund has not taken place until today when can i expect the money?;disappointed
 i have been a loyal customer of philips tooth brushes over the years i have 2 of these which now both have minor faults which philips will not supply me spares i was offered a 25% voucher to replace my existing faulty unit and now my 2nd unit has developed a fault hx 6950 i appreciate this model is no longer available the sonicare range has remained i think largely the same over the years i am disappointed with the reliability of the philips skincare and will now look for an alternative toothbrush

her co worker was ok but writing afterwards was impossible it was not at all on the problem and it is a only steune in the way i will not buy philips anymore ;disappointed
if the case has taken too long and instead of arranging you i am sent around myself to contact different departments have waited almost 3 months to receive two mugs that were a gift with the coffee machine and we understood that capsules were also included with the machine but were told yesterday that it didn't seems i could have had capsules because of long waiting time as a small patch on the wound ;disappointed
apparently the product i bought a year ago philips blue control now discontinued received no help regarding new straps for it or where i might be able to get them i imagine the warranty doesn't count for much either as when the bulb goes i guess i won't be able to purchase that either ;disappointed
the product i am enquiring about has been discontinued i was offered a discount voucher that is more expensive than the cost of the discontinued product i don't think in my opinion that is treating customers fairly and probably the reason people end up buying cheaper compatible products simply because they are forced to;disappointed
 disappointing is still flattered catastrophic would be the right expression i've tried several times also directly via philips to take care of my problem unfortunately without success i also got the answer i hang up now after which i asked for the name of the employee i'm still looking for the comb attachment et nr 422200274281 which kindly gave me a lady laut service center will be this part no longer produced instead i was offered a complete new essay for me completely incomprehensible dieter spies ;disappointed

take over the warranty for your product for which you advertise 3 years;disappointed
very poor english and patronising ;disappointed
you must develop routines and mandates to handle cases orders that do not work to have to wait 9 weeks call 7 telephone calls with bit by long telephone queue to communicate with the freight forwarder 8 times where i have no part in and never received any delivery before i receive notice of refund it is completely shabby and terrible it is an e commerce that is loser the customer is always right and his problem should always be solved in the first call then you have to solve your own problems or problems with subcontractors as in this case which caused a customer to have problems a reinforcement will be that customer service does not have a mandate and cannot escalate and that there are no routines for continuous feedback i had only been half as angry if customer service had been on a continuous basis ;disappointed
better products then the short warranty would be suitable;disappointed
to actually send the promised links and not just include my contact details to continue using them;disappointed
keep the app running so i have a device that i can throw in the bin because their people will not be able to get the wake up lights app working again and they still sell the parts the promised coupon for the purchase of philips devices i have not received until today that's how you shy away from customers ;disappointed
compromise with defective goods;disappointed
rather than asking many meaningless questions and re sampling existing data that are not at all expedient a sensible solution to the problem should be offered ;disappointed
more solutions in problem devices;disappointed
had the spare part i needed;disappointed
why no rep possible ??? device 3 years vacuum cleaner still sucks evt akku or charger defective?;disappointed
 since the error is a systematic problem that is part of the design you should replace the unit without discussion since this was not done but i got an offer to buy a new one with a certain discount i found out how i could fix the unit took 15min and thus philips lost all my confidence the error is part of the design and it is done for that the customer should think that the device is broken and buy a new one it would be easy to have a design where this does not happen and that means that the customer does not have to buy a new one but this is probably not in line with engineered end of life which is obviously what philips is doing here i had great confidence in philips before this and have bought many products from you and paid a premium for these this is over now unfortunately ;disappointed
i was promised a 20% coupon which was already approved by the supervisor arrived but nothing ;disappointed
i have not received an answer to my questions so far ;disappointed
a processing after the erstkontackt without multiple inquiries would be good ;disappointed
solve the problem faster and more agreeably not until 14 days after the 1st contact ;disappointed
more concrete more enlightening answer;disappointed
too many superfluous marketing questions rep did not know the answer i downloaded the manual for the answer the leaflet with the product needs reviewing as it is nigh on useless ;disappointed
show more goodwill;disappointed
find a solution it just said contact amazon ;disappointed
anything i solved by doing the factory reset instead of what was recommended to me by you ;disappointed
respond to the questions or comments the expressed criticism was not noticed ;disappointed
 no dodging with leaflet data instead i would have wished for an actual engagement with my request and honest answers ;disappointed
by sending me the right toothbrush on time ;disappointed
reply;disappointed
i was sent back the product without repair and without a cover letter i would have to check back and talk again for a long time and for a few more times even if the hotline was nice;disappointed
i was sent a link to the article selection when i selected the article in question it was claimed that it is not the nipple but the whole bottle the article was clearly suckers but even if it is noted in the internal system that it is the surface one can expect to know what you are talking about in addition the whole request was completely pointless since i was anyway recommended to look at the open market and one would not be responsible for product changes that could have been clarified even with the initial question and on the other side why is a customer service not responsible for complaints and help?;disappointed
replace the device;disappointed
respond to my emails in a timely manner or at all;disappointed
solve problems very disappointing ;disappointed
make a clear statement and offer a goodwill solution ;disappointed
promotions with 50% promise to receive well and not specify fake prices;disappointed
i have not been called back even though i live and communicate this existence my senseo is scrap quality again and the third machine in two years ;disappointed
since my device broke shortly after the warranty period i would have expected a replacement or repair on goodwill now i suspect that this is planned obsolescence so i will not buy any philips branded products anymore ;disappointed
the web shop was very difficult to use i was prompted to put in the house name but the field was not long enough i had to put my first name and second name in the first name field and use the second name field as the house name i was not prompted to leave out the first zero of my phone number i was left to work it out myself but could not continue until i did the post code was not accepted even though it was correct in the end i had to delete it and start again ;disappointed
i was sent a replacement handle for my failed product which was a lovely gesture the replacement unfortunately has also stopped working which i  m extre;disappointed
times answers if a customer wants something from you ;disappointed
just everything ;disappointed
customer service fine and persistent outcome disappointing offer of 25percent discount voucher is just not even remotely good enough for an expensive toothbrush only a few years old that is a serious design flaw had i known it would fail so quickly i would have not bought it in the first place ;disappointed
both contacts were not familiar with their new product nightbalancespt device and could not answer my questions ;disappointed
get an objective answer to the question asked and not a subjective opinion of the service employee;disappointed
make expensive products that last more than 12 months and provide decent service;disappointed
i wanted to buy some for a steamer that i lost a brush that is an additive but got the answer that they are not sold separately ;disappointed
products that are still repairable after the warranty period has expired;disappointed
had warranty but not on my model you said ;disappointed
the mention of a cause even a guess experience would have been helpful ;disappointed
as a solution offer something other than a discount voucher for the overpriced shop;disappointed
when i gave my serial number they could have seen how old the machine was and find a way to check that i only just hot the item from argos used it once only and it stopped working so disappinted could not get exchange or any help to be told none in stock i just binned it i'm really upset;disappointed
when you say you will get back within 3 days i expect you to get back within 3 days not to have to contact you again a week later ;disappointed
faster processing no changing contact persons;disappointed
it is unacceptable that i should buy an entire device because of an essay which of course i do not do more garbage not up to date;disappointed
don't send me to the store i bought off but instead took the product back directly;disappointed
i bought an electric toothbrush in 2016 and had an issue with the top of the toothbrush you kindly replaced and sent me a new one in jan 2018 the button on this toothbrush is stuck in and i cant get the programmes to work nor turn off without a lot of force i was advised by your excellent customer service manager that it cant be replaced i find this very strange as although the guarantee isn  t transferable the brush he;disappointed
my coffee machine was only superficially checked the error still exists so there is a shortcoming so that an exchange to a new device is necessary ;disappointed
my question about german descriptions were not answered the points that are important for the coffee machine are shown almost exclusively in english and in a video what are people doing who can not watch these videos? where can i find a video in german? according to today's explanations i can not recommend to buy a coffee machine 5000 series ;disappointed
i have the impression that people are not so familiar with the products ;disappointed
also older required spare parts should be available in the shop reference to external companies with shipping costs of 6  ;disappointed
 i would have expected a complete settlement a charger under the glass which is obviously defective and was bought with the toothbrush on 29 06 18 with the remark unfortunately out of warranty of 6 months not to exchange is anything but customer oriented sorry but i probably bought my last product from you ;disappointed
offer a cancellation option;disappointed
i wanted information on the weight of irons and this was not forthcoming;disappointed
adhere to given agreements;disappointed
find a way to supply the spare parts especially in these cases where the gasket breaking is very frequent ;disappointed
direct phone number and a contact person ;disappointed
effortless exchange of goods;disappointed
can deliver a requested small verschleissteil to my razor ;disappointed
more tolerance and goodwill better solutions ;disappointed
know your own products;disappointed
it was surprising to me how quickly your customer service processed my request absolutely disappointing however was that such a cheap spare part as the handle of the water tank is not offered as a spare part and instead only the complete water tank for almost 30 oo  must be purchased this i call customer rip off and impudence i will gladly recommend your company and products since;disappointed
faster response times on support it took 1 month between the answers from the e mail support ;disappointed
spare parts service for devices that are only 3 years old fully automatic coffee machine here water tank are available and do not refer to third party suppliers ;disappointed
everything;disappointed
the contact was very friendly and nice only the required part is unfortunately no longer available this is very disappointing for me because it is a device that is currently still being distributed ;disappointed
i wanted a spare part for my razor i was directed to a service point i ordered there and still wait for my spare part i will now switch to brown ;disappointed
be flexible and correct with clients who have bought various products from philips over the years;disappointed
the offer is disappointing especially since i've been using the philips perfect care elite silence since october november 2016 and now the device fills all the water in the descaling tank i expected that it still runs on goodwill ;disappointed
by announcing that the employee was on sick leave ;disappointed
create boards for old products ;disappointed
the waiting time in the chat was way too long> 15 minutes although supposedly at position 1 of the queue ;disappointed
the reception by phone and the creation of both case and solution was very quick and good that gives me high marks after that it became less good  no delivery no feedback delivery via ups was sent back to philips still no delivery ;disappointed
don  t change item with;disappointed
you could have offered me a solution and not with any product off what i did not order ;disappointed
the service phone number you gave me for athens was not obtainable i repaired my sonicare toothbrush with a part from the usa;disappointed
i already have a problem with my problem i can replace the batteries in my device if it does not have the official service;disappointed
clarify extended warranty product was registered ;disappointed
due to a wrong order i wanted to send the part back i was told that i should destroy the water tank and the amount already paid will be refunded to me this was 3 weeks ago and until today this amount is not credited to my account more than 2 weeks after a second phone call i was assured that this process lasts 14 days that would have been in the middle of last week ;disappointed
i'm sorry i bought so many of your products a shaving machine worth 85  with a warranty extension i took it back before it expires until i find you say;disappointed
not so extremely late response to the request and availability of the requested replacement;disappointed
nothing;disappointed
more accurate answers ;disappointed
explain more what i got to do returning the iron;disappointed
quick and accurate handling of complaints now two months have passed since i advertised my shaver but still have not been remedied ;disappointed
just listen to what i say ;disappointed
i wish there were the spare parts i asked for;disappointed
having bought the most expensive steam generator you currently sell at john lewis i would have expected it not to break within 4 months;disappointed
it's far too complicated to give anything back so use the warranty;disappointed
you should have offered me a solution for your discontinued product i bought the balance only because of the smartphone app now i own a scale that does not fulfill its purpose ;disappointed
it was not the service of the employee but the result of the defect ;disappointed
do not give evasive answers ;disappointed
to respond better to the customer's wishes;disappointed
parcel force should have researched the address;disappointed
the person did not respond to my questions and just wrote trivial stuff and let me wait besides she unjustifiably threw me out of the conversation when i was not writing because i was still waiting for an answer to the first question ;disappointed
more on the customer we had to send the unit several times because nothing was done until the last attempt that was very disappointing;disappointed
better understanding of my concerns to be less patronising to be more imaginative in getting a solution ;disappointed
the item promised was not revived;disappointed
i wished to be able to have a conversation with a member of staff of the department quality assurance and complaints and not after 14 days a further consolation at some point ;disappointed
i'm disappointed with the way the problem was solved ;disappointed
i actually wanted to clarify something about another one you also bought and not yet registered diamond care about what they have stated hx 9393 93 i then tried it by phone again and everything is ok and well ;disappointed
contact was good friendly mail etc result was unfortunately but somehow traceable ;disappointed
provide needed spare parts;disappointed
the device has just lasted 3 years for me only electronic waste and i will not buy philips products in the future ;disappointed
i think it's a pity that you have found no other solution to the problem since the warranty has expired for 3 days i should take a cost estimate that costs me 34 99  i can also buy the part again since the handle broke now for the second time in 4 years and the problem is also known by others according to the reviews this solution is not very customer friendly the grip is simply the weak spot of the otherwise good sucker unfortunately the call to you was therefore ve;disappointed
faster and clearer answers seemed to be the most important thing to receive from you not familiar with how the product worked ;disappointed

the indicated dealer might have been asked beforehand if they still have old spare parts as needed in my case the dealers then turned back to philips and that there were no parts for my device i already knew ;happy
my question was not completely clarified since no indication of the state of charge i would need specific charging instructions so as not to damage the battery the statement was that the battery is partially or not charged at delivery when partially full and then full charge according to instructions i would overload the battery and thereby damage that's exactly what i wanted to clarify with my request but i'm more or less left alone with the problem ;happy
good customer service and good product knowledge;happy

even though it was no longer treated as a warranty case we were given constructive and good solutions for our problem ;happy

the service was good even if the announced email with the part of the manual in question only came clearly after the phone call chat was against 8 email on after 12 the fact that there are different decalcification processes and finding out the right one with only the long serial number is not a customer service problem even if it is annoying ;happy
nice and helpful;happy
because the customer service advisor greek name was very helpful and patiently accepted our problem and finally solved it ;happy
to bring a better product to the market;happy
if your internet site online shop would only work better  ;happy
very friendly;happy
quick response;happy
the information on your web site indicating what a serial number looked like and where it was located were inadequate the location photo showed the interior of the shaving head area whereas the number was actually on the rear of the shaver second there was an indication that the serial number was 8 or more digits long whereas it was actually 5 ;happy

detailed answers to my questions ;happy

the question was clarified ;happy
speed in the answers to my questions;happy
the talks were always very friendly but i had to call a total of three times first tip to reinstall the app had not worked was worth a try the second time my name was misspelled despite spelling first and last name thus the mail did not arrive  therefore again call i had the bill and billing number in front of me  my data would have to be deposited already before had bought the device in the online shop of philips ;happy
speed in understanding the request resolution of the request education and courtesy i would have preferred to talk to an italian person but only for parochialism;happy
because after initially contradictory statements of different employees but a solution was found ;happy
and;happy
customer service okay however flat rate each time a repair for 190  is brazen did a year ago a  200 repair and now again ? for 400  i get a good new is not quite cu;happy

i got to speak to someone and they were very helpful i answered a few questions and soon after returning my old device the new one was sent back to me;happy
it was just an invoice that could be quickly retrieved from the system and emailed ;happy
i did not understand your payment system klarna at first;happy
have a quick response to my request received;happy
i sent you an email with picture and invoice number to philips ebay the answer was simple that i would like to enter this on your homepage there however a return would have been created automatically but since only the lid of the pasta machine was broken and i just wanted to have this replaced i had to call you telephonically so that was all very complicated for me the telephone advice and the service were but excellent ;happy
in the first chat has not been answered duration of the answers was sometimes quite long or no beep if answer exists so you sit very long in front of the calculator and waiting for an info;happy

because i quickly received a sufficient answer ;happy
ladies and gentlemen first of all i have to say that your co worker has put a lot of effort into answering the question unfortunately the desired spare part in your shop is no longer available which i am a little irritated by the not inconsiderable price of the perfect draft at the time and also causes no understanding however your coworker could not know we the tap is leaking unfortunately the recommended seal does not bring success unfortunately it is another sealing ring which seems to be leaking because the barrel loses its carbon dioxide if only the tap is put on so i guess i have to dispose of the perfect draft if i can not get another solution a new purchase i would think a lot because of the now made bad experiences because the system is only rarely in use sincerely martin lenckowski;happy
good service qualified employee to provide professional service;happy
my initial problem was with the handle as the rubber was peeling off but as it was deemed out of warranty i was offered a 30% voucher so of course i would of preferred a replacement handle ;happy

warranty service could have been faster now it took about 1 month when i got the product back for repair but the main thing was that the product was repaired ;happy
despite the holidays my request was promptly answered;happy
making the search for the service center easy it is a bit confusing today;happy
maybe more detail on my question and answer something in more detail but i came after a few experiments behind the operation of the toothbrush alright ;happy

for the availability consistency punctuality and speed of the assistance service provided;happy

i was served very well and the lady was very helpful ;happy

the instructions for the philips bear trimmer i purchased are not very clear it would have been beneficial if you could have sent some down that were more relevant to my query;happy
the first call on 27 12 2018 at your hotline was very nice and convinced me to order the toothbrush on 31 12 2018 i called again the coworker was totally annoyed about my questions unfortunately no comparison to my first call i had questions about the brushes i've been using oral b toothbrushes for years and the abundance of toothbrushes on offer has made it incredibly easy on the internet especially if i can not find a comparable toothbrush for the ordered toothbrush or it no longer exists the employee could have gone a little harder i tell her that today i still want to place the order on the internet too bad if this had been the first conversation i would never have ordered the toothbrush sincerely brigitta deuble@web de;happy
advice asked for and answer given;happy
colleague was able to answer my request specifically and perform me on the basis of the manual;happy
the gentleman on the phone was very friendly and could give me an information the website of philips is very confusing and very complicated for my taste i could not find my product when registering i then chose an almost identical one ;happy
customer contact was very good also thanks to the staff only a delivery time of 10 12 days i think a bit steep but i can not use my coffee machine for latte machiatto or co amazon would send me the spare part in less than two days a pity otherwise satisfied ;happy
if you have a defective 10 month old coffee machine for more than 1500 euro you would like to have a replacement machine for the time of repair  ;happy
it is not possible to download the chatlog via smartphone it is also not possible to have the protocol sent to you by email ;happy

i've got great help what would be good is that the manuals are in the box of the product i buy ;happy

so i had to wait 3 months on the charger which had been exposed shortly after the delivery of the toothbrush that's pretty long  each time my concern or the problem was not passed on and thus pulled the whole thing down now another child toothbrush is not working for one of my patients and does not want to know how long it will take her to be helped ;happy

my questions could be answered;happy
yes i was satisfied;happy
good day the ladies and gentlemen you could in the product info the clean system already standardize the 8000 series since the non listing uncertainties the same although it could logically assume that it is a mistake in the document since the 8000 series is identical except for the digital display with the 9000 series then the request would have been spared and a synchronous purchase had already been carried out ;happy
my concern has been clarified;happy
alexandra was a happy and service minded person ;happy
quick response just a pity that the goods are not available in the store as the recommended dealer more expensive than in the shop;happy
it was the service;happy
i do not know;happy
neutral information got all the information i needed ;happy
 although i could not show a real solution but a kind of alternative solution contact to klarna and the perspective that if it does not go down for me a kind of process was created number was called so that the next client advisor knows what's up & helps me well ;happy
everything great ;happy

not sure;happy
very good accessibility fast processing of the process;happy
solved the problem ;happy
i got an answer that was expected ;happy

friendly cooperative with the return of the product toasters since the desired degree of roast with the product was not achievable;happy
it took a long time to assess the faulty product before a replacement was offered even though the iron had malfunctioned twice each time overheating & burning out in a potentially dangerous way when the assessment was made the offer of a new enhanced product was made which was obviously very satisfactory thank you ;happy
good response dimitris was very good ;happy

 your customer service has sent me to sertronic the first information from sertronic was that i had to buy the holder for the shaving heads sep another employee of the sertronic was then better in the picture  and has confirmed my assumption that i can use the rq12 70 for my razor this was my original question and the answer to that would have to be known to the philips customer service in my view  ;happy

the coworker was friendly and also very hard working to solve my problem unfortunately they could raise neither about a dealer nor the online shop for me cleaning cartridges it is probably at philips the whole delivery system with cleaning cartridges over a very long period completely come to a standstill now finally the dealers have been able to deliver of course they did not forget to correct the prices was a very popular article now i wonder was that the intention?;happy
inquiry was answered quickly but i have ordered two combs this is broken only by the use i do not understand that is clearly a material error for me i hope that the replacement combs lift longer ;happy

the problem was solved well by the employee in customer service but the reason for the contact was that the promised gift on purchase and registration was not sent out this seemed to me to have been reminded of and that there was insufficient guidance and communication on the website when registering ;happy

when there are several spare parts for a product and at the same time extra equipment is sold that is very similar to each other you get easily confused so describe what is in the box when buying when you set up as a customer however you have to adjust the entry fields to danish conditions you can for example do not write all  or 22 2 tv if you have written something the template does not like then it is very difficult to correct it the certain typing fields do not fit with the number of characters if you use google's auto fill then it goes c;happy
qualified statements of the employee ;happy
could ask if it was an old product and informed asked about the error possibly could be covered by a guarantee otherwise good stuff ;happy

i was helped very well nice and very friendly;happy

i got an answer to my question ;happy
my concern was finally solved well but the dialogue period was tedious the period from my notification of the warranty 24 11 18 to the dispatch confirmation of the spare part of scb 11 01 19 is a bit fierce ;happy
competent friendly patient;happy
contact would have been unnecessary if the information on your website had been correct;happy
service was very good unfortunately there was not the spare part that i needed so i paid 50  for a new device instead of 2 ;happy

your website regarding customers logging on to extend the guarantee could be a little more user friendly i would suggest the following in the literature with the product simply give the website address for guarantee extn then ask for ref no or model to be entered then continue with whatever marketing info then finally register ;happy
i would like to know why this range of shavers seem to consistently fail after just 1 year of use so whilst i appreciate the offer of a replacement it doesn't get to the root of the problem ;happy
fast and accurate delivery of spare part that was broken though i could have used that employee had written in english and not swedish when not everyone in denmark understands swedish ;happy
fast accessibility sometimes misleading instructions in case of damage but this always includes 2 very hard and extensive care advice;happy
the response was quick i did expect to be advised to buy the most expensive item but i wasn't i thought that when i phoned that i would be speaking to someone in the technical department though that way my query would be discussed with someone knowledgeable which would have guided my choice but i'm happy with the outcome well i hope to be once my replacement iron arrives ;happy
at the moment i feel satisfied;happy
the customer service was very friendly in terms of content the lady could not prevent that our next toothbrush will not be a philips model anymore twice each broke shortly after warranty plus goodwill ;happy
i was helped relatively quickly and very friendly ;happy
the spare part that i needed was only available from a partner dealer i thought that was a pity in addition the part incl shipping would cost me 25 euros a new device costs 65 since i prefer to exchange completely ;happy

i loved my main steam tank uber iron but it has had a few technical issues that have lessened the ardour  and my quick back up use cordless philips iron is great but has to be replaced for reheating so often that it gets irritating the quality of the products initially is superb but the longevity is in question for me and i'm not sure whether i just was unlucky or whether that's standard hence the 7 instead of the 9 for recommendation ;happy
friendly answer;happy
perfect;happy

do not know what ;happy
the final solution that was offered to me on the phone was a bit irritating but with the additional mail i got then everything was clear maybe the staff should be a bit clearer about solutions to problems but otherwise the staff was very nice and accommodating my problem has been completely resolved and i am very satisfied ;happy

good reception;happy
better description of the items in the online shop that contacting the customer service is not necessary ;happy

the friendly way of communication;happy
explanations to the requested models were given understandable;happy
everything was ok for me;happy
quick answer to my question;happy
my request was able to process it quickly and satisfactorily;happy

politeness helpfully ;happy
simple organization and solution of the concern;happy
that registration page would work properly;happy
make apple products compatible;happy
sluggish and seemed unaware although product and problem was at least hinted in the run up ;happy
let's wait;happy
the advisor did everything she could to try and help promptly and efficiently and when the problem couldn't be resolved the issue of a discount voucher against a possible replacement was very welcome ;happy
it would have been better if my customer service calls had also provided satisfactory answers then i would not have had to make a mail request ;happy
the colleague was very committed to a solution was always friendly and took a lot of time;happy
friendly and competent;happy
i'm happy because the responding operator took charge of my request and was very helpful;happy

a wonderful customer service lady helen dealt with my claim professionally and efficiently extremely quickly after having issues for months with my claim being ignored by the customer services team;happy
it was a bit pushy to this survey;happy

fully satisfied;happy
everything was satisfactory;happy
if it had been written down what was agreed then it would have been easier the next time we call;happy
don't know;happy
the call handler was a delight efficient and friendly but efficient good product knowledge ;happy
very good and professional customer service ;happy
i got immediate response from a person they resolved my issue broken kettle promptly and the cheque just arrived in the mail ;happy
the information was unfortunately not sufficient for an immediate purchase decision my question was whether the 9 series includes other or even better blade systems had bought me a good 5 years ago but i am not satisfied with the cutting quality a reply mail with voucher and product information did not arrive either address roweza@gmx de;happy
zoe was very good listened to my problem and sent replacement blades for 5000 however my 7000 is the best phillips i have owned the others of many philips owned were disappointing ;happy
i had wanted more detailed knowledge of the product ;happy
the answer was understandable;happy
nothing;happy
everything settled for the best;happy
everything done quickly ;happy
make a kettle that lasts a reasonable time 5 months is poor and the previous one one year ;happy
good advice nice contact good customer satisfaction ;happy
friendly patient person;happy
talking to a knowledgeable technician at you could probably provide better information ;happy
unfortunately i have no answer to the post processing of my question but an apology that the question can not be answered because it is another department ;happy
friendly and comprehensive information;happy
faster answers but due to illness it is understandable;happy
reached quickly competent answer and good service when ordering;happy
previous announcement of the documents required for the processing possibly insert on tape recorder;happy
 if i could go to a website of yours that shows pictures of my electric shaver i could then
positively identify the parts that i need replacing instead of trying to explain this over the
phone ;happy
the problem lay in the fact that when trying to register two new electric toothbrushes the serial numbers on the product did not match any in the official list on the philips website i was given the 'corresponding' numbers to match them with those on the list during the live chat while the query was dealt with quite efficiently it did take 20 minutes time that could have been saved by both me and the philips customer care agent had the official list contained the numbers that appeared on the products and didn't need 'interpreting' ;happy
better explanations on the homepage would have made the contact unnecessary;happy
simply fast;happy
fast precise answer that's the way it has to be ;happy
faster delivery of the required article ;happy
very patient despite repeated mail;happy
fast friendly and very accommodating customer service ;happy
timely completion highly competent friendly in dealing with the customer ;happy
nothing;happy
very helpful;happy
speed in responses and attention to customer needs operator courtesy;happy
waiting time was a bit long i did not know when to call customer service ;happy
problem need for repair in the philips model is known philips although there is no guarantee i was recommended the goodwill department of your house result however still open ;happy
because the problem has been solved and what was said in the previous contact had been maintained at the end of 2018;happy
that was very informative and friendly especially speaking directly with a person without a machine announcement was very pleasant i can not think of any improvement;happy
less stressful;happy
delivery only after 10 days as an order is necessary ;happy
the staff were very patient and helpful however as i am not in to computers and if the instructions were in layman's terms step by step instruction then i may not have needed the help of your staff on the phone too register my trimmers thank you for the help;happy
quick response and fast shipping of the service part to be exchanged ;happy
because i had difficulty finding an accessory on the site which thanks to a collaborator i was able to find;happy
i have been contacted several times to try to solve the problem i had encountered with the website;happy
customer focussed ;happy
faster response;happy
because i was helped uncomplicated ;happy
clear information and above all fast;happy
to get an answer;happy
for now nothing;happy
i was happy with what i was told the only reason that i have been neutral about recommending philips is that i do not presume to know in detail what other people require from a company ;happy
solved the problem promptly;happy
courtesy and availability of staff;happy
i was given advice which had the potential to enable me to apply adjustments which had the potential to extend the life of my product ;happy
the gentleman i spoke to was very helpful;happy
everything was just as it was;happy
not needed;happy
clear and ready answers;happy
i managed to speak very quickly with an operator ilaria from athens in this case ilaria proved to be extremely helpful courteous and professional in fact i immediately bought the article for which i asked for some clarifications congratulations also to his italian absolutely perfect thank you;happy
directly swedish speaking people when calling from swedish telephone number sincerely ;happy
as long as one is prepared to investigate the course of action to follow its ok it might be problematical for others;happy
because apart from the problem that was partly solved they were friendly and professional ;happy
because of the clear response from customer care;happy
i got exactly the answers i needed for my decision regarding the device ;happy
 service ok but the reason for the defect is a product defect a pity that you have to pay for the replacement part yourself ;happy
because the customer service employee showed consistency and understanding ;happy
everything ok ;happy
your website;happy
because they helped me solve the problem;happy
the handling of my case;happy
the help was ok but the recommendation for your own spare parts sale which is more than twice as expensive as your own recommended price and 3 times higher compared to your eefs as you point from the website service a bit crazy but otherwise everything was fine;happy
very polite;happy
all ok;happy
hard to say ;happy
i got help unfortunately it did not resolve but got a compassion;happy
emailed initially and had no reply rang few days later and excellent help provided and replacement received next day ;happy
quick and easy;happy

i got to know what i needed fixed than it took 2 days that somebody called back what i thought was really bad;happy
spare part for coffee machines;happy
the technical advice was friendly and informative;happy
give faster answer;happy
i do not know;happy
the service was good in the end but the initial response was to send parts which i found impossible to fit when i responded again the shaver head was quickly replaced which was the correct response it would have been better if this had been the initial response to my problem ;happy
the connection on the phone takes too long until you get the appropriate partner ;happy
everything was good ;happy
although the product had a part missing which doesn't reassure one of the companies quality control the cs advisor tried to resolve the problem quickly and when she realised it was an amazon purchase quickly took me through the return process which was flawless ;happy
do not know;happy
fast and friendly answer ;happy
very polite and friendly customer service;happy
friendly and helpful;happy
the product arrived quickly here but is also broken ;happy
informative friendly good handling of the complaint;happy
i had called and spoke to someone who confirmed my devicw was broken he was pledant and professional he was happy to exchange my device but didnt have any in stock he sent me an email of our conversation so that i could take it to the shop i bought it from to exchange it ;happy
all the best fast correct answer;happy
because they answered my question;happy
receive concrete satisfactory info about the question;happy
i received an answer soon;happy
do not just use standard answers train persil better the answers were also available on the internet;happy
the man was very friendly and helpful;happy
promote the required electric broom ;happy
greater goodwill there are countless lawsuits by airfryer owners whose devices break after 2 years that's quite a scandal some report that they get a new device on goodwill i was offered 10% discount on the purchase of a new in the overpriced philips online store it must not be even to the environment to love not that the durability is so limited scandalous ;happy
maybe the writing can be done faster in a job the telephone call with the telephone colleague took a long time because he might not know so well with the filling out of the forms ;happy
i have explained my problem and i am a loyal customer have already bought many toothbrushes discount on new purchase so i stayed philps faithful;happy
as my request seems to be being dealt with swiftly so far ;happy
professionalism;happy
quick response to my question by mail;happy
bigger discount on replacement product;happy
service was good then when i would order just so oh it is no longer in stock ;happy
clear and exhaustive answers;happy
if i had got a higher discount then i would have been happier but the big problem was that it was not possible to buy from the middle aged reader and the usual shop in the same shopping cart ;happy
good service went to get in touch quickly professional treatment;happy

the answer was quick and clear but why philips omits an accessory which costs only a few cents and for which there is even a recess in the packaging i did not want to open up and could not be explained to me so it remains incomprehensible too bad ;happy

quick answer to my question;happy
more goodwill;happy
giving a better discount when buying a new product understand that you cannot do so much when the receipt is missing but that the toothbrush was manufactured in 2013 may be facts but it did not come in my possession in 2013 but do not know for yourself when it was bought only that it stopped working completely suddenly now however i chanced to buy a similar toothbrush made in 2018 remains to see if it only dies one day or if it lasts a few years bought from another store because their price was about the same as what you had in your webshop with my compensation discount ;happy
asked for brush head for my super old electric toothbrush they were no longer available but got a discount code of 40% to buy new ;happy

 the assessment could actually have been enthusiastic that it is not so is your financier klarna to blame we wanted to pay the philips akkusauger by invoice the online processing went through without problems to the obligatory thank you since i still had no confirmation email the following day i called your service hotline there they told me that klarna had rejected the payment by invoice and therefore no order would have come about that alone i found already snubbing then i ordered the device a second time with payment via paypal the confirmation email came immediately a few hours later i received another confirmation email from klarna for the first order after a new call to your hotline they tried to clarify by canceling the first order after all your employees at the service hotline were able to clarify the problem after another phone call thank you very much your financial institution klarna had a particularly negative impact on me there is no telephone hotline available for such cases instead an alleged life chat with automated answers for the present case no solution was offered there quite apart from the fact that i would not like to be addressed by a financial institution with you especially after a non acceptance of an order klarna acts on me overbearing to mocking recently i would recommend philips to refer more clearly to the involvement of a financial institution in the option purchase on account sincerely g + h medrow ;happy

easier to speak to your service office ;happy
not sure there was anything more that could have been done;happy
 the addition in the promised time of 4 weeks to deliver and not that you as a customer after 7 weeks still have to ask by phone and by mail i was very upset about it and the value of 50  was not met the coffee costs about 13  if i take the value of a high quality thermal mug which does not even look high quality are also about 13  then together 26  philips would have stood on it then the promised value of 50  would be justified and it wou ;happy
nothing;happy
when a mistake was made philips immediately made good and said the mistakenly shipped part did not have to be returned ;happy
you couldn't;happy
the lady was very helpful and answered all my questions ;happy

do not know;happy
call was well handled but the item i was after is no longer available as philips have decided to stop supplying the coloured rings with their replacement tooth brush heads very bad idea ;happy
nothing more than what you did;happy
quick response ;happy
improve the warranty issue in case of replacement as it happened to me i do not find it right that the previous expiration of the old product is valid if the new one is also faulty? i would be after a few months out of warranty it is not wrong x very expensive items ;happy

i received my information and was served quickly ;happy

customer service was relevant;happy

absolutely perfect help with the warranty case but took about 20 days to get a new item well long time ;happy
i would like to refer to the e mail change the service has gone to great lengths and was very friendly i also get a partial refund but i would have expected that one commented on the faulty part trim essay there must be a production error if not even a replacement instead of refunding the partial amount ;happy

web pages that work properly with proper pointers;happy
dear ladies and gentlemen my question or concerns have been satisfactorily clarified by your employee sincerely otto pardey;happy
 if your website had worked properly in the first place  i only needed to make contact with the online chat because the registration process did not give me access to register the product i did successfully register a toothbrush  and i tried logging off and logging in again but the registration process available to meopnly gave me a component of the airfloss pro to the unit itself 

i will add i rate the products i have purchased first class but your website is less helpful i did some research before purchase and there is some lack of clarity about products and the product names and equivalent names used by distributors  i bought through john lewis  not least the prices ;happy
better german knowledge would have been great ;happy
he helped me;happy
offer german courses for employees to improve communication on the phone ;happy
super fast delivery;happy
an order was canceled but the delivery service came by to get the device ;happy
has made an effort this is not commonplace someone knows who actually paid the salary ;happy
nice and friendly;happy
anything;happy
i am not;happy
i got answers to my questions quickly and accurately ;happy
it would be better if the required spare part had been found in your assortment or a reference to the universal replacement brush would have been apparent but the forwarding to the corresponding link on amazon was fine ;happy
i was listening to what i had to say ;happy
even better knowledge about the desired spare part but probably was not easy because the original part shaving head hq8 for my shaver pt860 is obviously no longer available the employee has tried very hard to find the right shaving heads for my razor has also worked very well after some back and forth delivery has been made and the shaving heads fit ;happy
has fit ;happy

him my service person was sweet and welcoming and really helpful but his information is erroneous when he stated that your grind & brew 7766 00 only has one prayer chamber i was looking for an explanation of the difference between 7766 and 7769 and he explained this as a difference but when i later bought the machine based on his statements it turned out that it actually has two chambers it is definitely a bonus and everything else he has stated has been correct but just this bit of knowledge you must have updated in your system ;happy
it was good ;happy

i did not worry because i was very satisfied with the call ;happy
the service was friendly and fast the required spare part is repaired so i had to buy it overpriced on the internet it is disappointing anyway that the device has barely survived the warranty period the fact that this bateil has broken is certainly due to the structurally too weak interpretation of the component ;happy
good & fast service;happy
it could not answer the question of whether the cutting unit is included in the scope of delivery due to the illustration and the service but she could help me a lot because of the return possibility the part came as desired and i am completely satisfied ;happy

fast and friendly reaction in the thing itself diskount for an article which was on the way and which was meanwhile cheapened could not be helped me;happy
since the complaint is not yet completed i can not answer this question ;happy
i got answers to what i wanted to know;happy
a really good experience shopping with philips ;happy
i can not think of anything ;happy
they were very courteous they also proceeded more quickly than budgeted and finally they completely replaced the damaged goods;happy
available and competent;happy
 the person i spoke to was very helpful and although i had been trying to register our toothbrushes using the method contained within them it just would not work so i telephoned and the person i spoke to was very helpful and registered the 2 sonicare toothbrushes for me 
thank you very much ;happy

the last contact who could finally help me  i begged philips to refund the money for the canceled product and the only one whatever she tells me call her at klarna and klarna always says call philipps   and the mistake was really with philipps    without sending klarna a confirmation that the return has arrived at philipps the money can not be paid and the philipps customer service always said call klarna  the lastze has finally responded and sent an e mail to klarna finally  do you know how much time i spent in queues at philipps and klarna? how much time i each new employee all again had to explain  i am trouble a tired greeting annette schepers;happy
got the required information but i do not understand why philips can not offer me a spare part for a current vacuum cleaner or one at a dealer in d in which the spare part costs 50% more than the specified eia on the philips website ;happy
quick response individual text not building blocks that do not fit the question;happy
upload facility on the chat app did not work;happy
everything was good;happy
all questions were answered extensively nice and friendly conversation without false backgrounds no sales intentions  ;happy
because the answer came quickly and the answer contained a possible alternative ;happy
the conversation was very clear and friendly the feedback via email came relatively fast ;happy
my question was sufficiently answered and the feedback was very friendly ;happy

i can not say exactly now ;happy
shorten waiting times for calls;happy
guy on the other end of the phone very helpful;happy
by telling us that the device's user manual contains an error when establishing a wi fi connection ;happy
the turn around time could have been quicker but at the end of the day i am satisfied;happy
i was very unpleasantly surprised by the short life span of just two years for my sonicare hx9350 before i visited your website saturn offered me to submit the handpiece for a fee of  49 00 it would be desirable from an ecological point of view to get this repaired or replaced but it is not offered by the company my new sonicare hx9359 89 including 2nd set of charging station glass travel baguette  will hopefully last longer my highest rating is for the friendly accommodating ladies with their coupon offer;happy
a little faster the answer to the questions;happy

problem solved ;happy
it took time for me and the customer service could answer all my questions ;happy
very happy;happy
helpful;happy
no that;happy
not argued that my product was broken and cause such frustration ;happy
 if you designed devices that are designed to last longer and are so expensive compared to others you could easily have bought 2 other branded devices spare parts should also be available that was a frustrating experience from which i will draw my conclusions also i will have to correct my very good reviews on my philips kitchen helpers in the area of quality and sustainability again especially in this case that was really bitter to hear that i can throw away a working several hundred euros expensive blender because the glass container is broken cheers benny ;happy
the processing takes too long i had to wait 26 days for an answer for a medical therapy device too long i could not redeem my voucher because it was not sent to hungary ;happy

would be good if i actually got the product i order weeks ago ;irritated
if you ask me for customer service feedback why would i like to have contact? on my request i have only received an automatic message and the request for feedback  a little bit to give feedback on customer service;irritated
swedish speaking customer service someone who directly understood that i wanted to return an incorrect product and not have anyone else in exchange ;irritated
actually dealt with my issues over a month later i am still waiting for any form of resolution ;irritated
there is the model of the hair clip i bought to complete the warranty extension i posted through your website it was not the registration not by my own misconduct ;irritated
help me solve problems;irritated
the treatment took a long time many emails and phone calls;irritated
 already we have been supported by your technical assistance service with the result that the product has back with any other problem different from the previously marked assembly of the machine buckled screws and threaded in the gear to mill the coffee and with different packaging from which in which it has been sent and that is the original of the machine it is better not to ask your support approfit to respond to the next question if to contact me means continue to say that the problem has not been solved when another has been generated and that proposes another withdrawal after thousands of mail in which i clarped that i want to respond clear as well happened then the answer is no ;irritated
customer service by philipps in switzerland would be very desirable instead they interview and question them and then refer them to sertronics ;irritated
all the information that their employees pass on are also discussed with each other i have contacted her several times and i have always got other information or have to tell again and again and again from the beginning what my concern is at some point i was tired so very disappointing ;irritated
 answer the phone answer the whatsapp give proper advice ie ensure the equivalent toothbrush is ordered not a lower spec one when you refuse to replace a faulty tooth brush 

on the positive side when i did get through to your people they are very nice and professional apart from their recommendations ;irritated
unfortunately the link to the manual can not be opened maybe it is too late today but i could not react sooner ;irritated
listen;irritated
 everything it was not recalled the first time the second time all tests would be carried out it was determined that the device had to be sent in but then no repair order was sent the device was sent cleaned the reaparturservice could find no error and sent the device with distributed coffee powder in the packaging back with the comment you would have checked the device out of goodwill presumably this serves the adjustments of the quality statistics all in all very bad ;irritated
given me the correct information you told me you would not honour the warranty so i went out and bought a new unit only to then receive a replacement unit back from you a week later crap service ;irritated
despite information about returns on my part multiple payment request and no response to my mails;irritated
sent the correct exchange product ;irritated
send me a razor i have phoned 4 times everyone has been polite and apologetic but i am still waiting for the shaver i ordered on 13th december 2018 ;irritated
brush head for about  5 reclaimed probably costs around  0 50 no replacement granted because buying too long ago who checks all purchased brushes in a pack of 6 before use ??? but coupon for the next purchase ;irritated
actually answer the questions without me waiting as long and then cut me off ;irritated
philips staff need priority training in deaf awareness to gain a knowledge of text relay my wife who is profoundly deaf was left humiliated and distressed after contacting phillips consumer department ;irritated
i tried to order a replacement foil head for my phillips shaver but could not do it via my smart phone as the site kept on freezing or cutting out i eventually had to do so via a pc ;irritated
your customer service dept is a disgrace and i will never buy another philips product;irritated
do not sell so much crap and leave customers in the rain with problems with their devices ;irritated
really answer my questions and not just a copy of something i could have found on the website myself;irritated
customer service never returned so i had to pick up myself after 10 days when i then got a contact i would answer a rather irrelevant question that you yourself have answers to in your system i referred to dates etc and then have not heard from you has been going about a month since then if it is not so atg ngt of your e mail responses ended up in a garbage basket and then i ask you to resend it thank you in advance with warm greetings efva bengtsson a;irritated
make products that last and back them up with good service;irritated
the question whether the device would have to keep the temperature after opening the water flow was not answered;irritated
just answer the question it should be no secret as to what batteries are contained within your product and withholding the information has prevented me from being able to send the product to its recipient ;irritated
better u produce more durable products;irritated
solving the problem would be a start ;irritated
quick exit of the employee before question was really clarified ;irritated
 concrete questions mail will not be received and you will receive speech bubble answers after three contact a question from mail 1 is answered and issued as wisdom last conclusion final you feel crazy in addition illegal legal information is given as if i did not have the original package to the rear i could not claim my money back guarantee despite serious deficiencies this is unlawful because the statutory warranty is plowed by such stupid information that would be charged against phillips reminder i waived my admonition as i got the price from the shipper real in the meantime from real i also got the information that phillips got incompatible airfloss with incompatible refill stations and therefore stopped the distribution never again philips ;irritated
by replying to my message instead of ignoring it ;irritated
i did not receive an email from athens;irritated
slow to get new prod if compared to buying new long time and got to call 4g in the same case fixk however had two replacement products and called this but then also had to keep the other product so it was patches on the wounds so overall ok;irritated
for example keep the commitments i am still waiting to be contacted the operator told me to send photos there serial because he could not trace the model and then he told me that the same evening or the day after another would call me to provide assistance we talk about an iron not the orbiting station in space;irritated
i have been trying for about 6 months to get my razor blade replaced or in such a condition that it is better than my many years old razor line buy top of the line and get a worse product is not good looking forward to how you intend to solve my case mvh stellan morberg stellot5@gmail com 0708194162;irritated
we have not been contacted by you i attach the mail traffic to this page if possible otherwise you can contact me again ;irritated
i had to create an account to register a product the account would not verify and so i was unable to do this i just kept going around in circles i don  t want an account there must be a far simpler way to register? what happened to good old fashioned speaking to a customer se;irritated
let me know when products i enquired about would become available ;irritated
solve the problem faster offer loan product;irritated
the chat line is so slow the first chat line person didn  t send me email so had to re contact ;irritated
replied to my email;irritated
by feedback;irritated
well  i didn't get any help at all or answer my question  the person who would help me to answer a fairly simple question in the chat asked me for a minute and then disappeared from the chat ;irritated
straight forward simple guidance on emailing philips you need to be a technophobe to get to emailing i understand the reasons of security actions for me and you but after several tries with the information given i gave up and went to amazon to get the parts i wanted ;irritated
the only thing i wanted was to find out where i could buy a spare part for my vacuum cleaner on the map i received there was no selection at all seems like the whole thing was just a joke very disappointed ;irritated
answer the questions and not just finish the conversation as fast as possible;irritated
well sometimes the product to look at;irritated
give customer support in swedish and not english your phone has been ridiculously understaffed for the last 3 days and the queue time has been grotesquely long educate your support staff so they know which campaigns you have and teach them to read on your various websites we never came to the same page on the web ;irritated
we have two products criticized and hoped for clarification yes a product has been replaced but unfortunately only one and also without any info the filter that has been replaced can not currently be procured via your shop instead we are linked to amazon and can order the same filter that we have criticized is this a satisfactory solution?;irritated
device documentation available showing how to install a solved part again ;irritated
better product knowledge;irritated
contacted is on december 17 when i wanted advice on which vacuum cleaner i would buy on january 2 i received an answer and then in english had expected me an answer earlier especially when it came to a potential sale for you ;irritated
i had to dispose of two of your company's sonycare toothbrushes because they have recently switched on by themselves unfortunately the warranty expired colleague of hotline promised me 20 percent coupon when buying a new brush coupon never arrived never again philips ;irritated
felt it was u necessary to need me to compete so many details of;irritated
react faster and more meaningful;irritated
the people were helpful however the website for ordering a replacement product was not intuitive even though your were offering a replacement at half price i eventually gave up i ordered a similar product from amazon and saved money too ;irritated
you didn  t respond to my query i sent photos twice then i kept getting e mails saying you were going to close the query very confusing ann;irritated
you have supplied us with 3 faulty baby monitors which have all stopped working after approx 1 year with the same problem faulty charger connection you could have served us better by acknowledging the problem and manufacturing products that last instead of wasting the planet's resources with built in obsolescence and then hiding behind your warranty ;irritated
by refunding me  54 for an incorrect item you sent and i returned and was received by yourselves on the 12th november and after 1 email and 4 telephone calls i am still waitin;irritated
only ask for a rating when the case is completed and not before i feel very irritating;irritated
everything;irritated
by sending the cheque with the correct details and not in the wrong name and still not paying us;irritated
do not cancel the connection and connect again with the same advisor ;irritated
answers in concrete terms links that work not just be politely handled i have spent many hours not been contacted again and am therefore aware that i avoid philips when the product is expensive several thousand the product does not work and is not repaired and the service is poor there is nothing left ;irritated
listened to what i was saying;irritated
i needed a rubber seal for a blender your agent gave me the contact a spare parts company that only dealt with shavers ;irritated
the first thing started with that we went back to elkj  p on rolvs  y where we had bought hd 9220 20 the reason was that we had not received a grill grill that was included on the offer the purchase took place on 31 10 18 then let's be told that we ourselves had to talk to the main supplier philips when we thought it was completely unreasonable when we thought elkj  p had to take this responsibility they tried to call philips but did not come on the phone the day after we were then called on that they did not arrive by phone then return to elkj  p to get help to get in touch with philips the clerk asks us to wait so we can talk to someone who was better known with the product stocks to wait about 30 min the clerk comes to tell us that the other was good to eat break even though he was aware that we were waiting remembered we traveled home and tried to call philips self phone number on the net that we tried thank you with mari and she as she writes mail adr on and i write a letter and try to email this several times get back message that this mail adr could not be reached then call back to philips and explain what has happened talked to a nice swedish man who occasionally send mail back to elkj  p on rolvs  y in the afternoon they call us and we agreed to copy of the confirmation that we had bought hd9220 20 also confirmation from philips that we were registered and that we were to receive the grill grille in a short time many bother for s;irritated
be more serious ;irritated
it took over two months before my complaint was dealt with i had to move repeatedly and i got no answer when i finally get an answer you cannot replace the defective product and i have to get my money back you can then not just deposit the money on the credit card that has been used for the first time for the purchase the money is transferred to my bank account but as this is done from another country sweden my bank takes a handling fee of dkk 70 therefore i have not really got all my money back and i have had an unnecessarily long complaint process with a lots of trouble;irritated
i found the questions that were put to me very confusing and it would be great to let myself be excused;irritated
recognised that the shaver i bought stopped working inside the warranty period  very unhappy;irritated
by calling within a reasonable time was allowed to call back again after approx 45 min ;irritated
some real knowledge of products and greater awareness of the diverse reasons for a customer query ;irritated
we had to send in the purchase invoice but have not heard anything until today as it goes on ;irritated
my concerns to edit and give feedback;irritated
to train the support staff's knowledge of products and accessories;irritated
i can't get a product because you don't have it in stock you have to find this yourself by asking in depth questions for your support then i have to wait for you to get it in stock if you get it in stock no one knows anything before i can order it again it must then be said to be one of the worst webshops i have visited ;irritated
find a solution ;irritated
 by answering my query 
i've been waiting several weeks for a response but despite follow ups i still haven't received the answer ;irritated
the attitude that i'm not a supplicant but their company has missed something it was not there ;irritated
by giving a direct answer instead of referring to someone else;irritated
you could be more interested in your customers than waiting for a whole month to tell me what to do with the defective product i bought still you have not even gotten me for an apology that i did not serve and i felt like an idiot too ;irritated
black on request instead to just forward to new department;irritated
recognising an electric toothbrush should last longer than 2 years although it was out of guarantee ;irritated
 the website is out of date not impressive for a company like philips  when did you buy your product ? goes up to 2018 ;irritated
by sorting out your product information on your packaging and products when i tried to register my product online it was impossible to achieve because the correct product no was not on the box or on the product either i called your helpline number and your representative was as confused as myself and found it difficult to understand what was wrong she gave me another number but when i entered that it would not work either so i called your helpline again after some quite lengthy research by your representative she found that my product actually had two product numbers and gave me the correct one i was then able to register my product but the whole exercise was extremely frustrating cost me an hour of my time and two telephone calls there were four different numbers on the box packaging and one on the product and none of them were correct this may be something you'd like to look into because if this is happening commonly no one can register their new product with you kev corcoran ;irritated
the answer probably refers to another device because there mentioned buttons on my device are not present;irritated
 by canceling the extra order that was made which i asked you both on your site and partly by phone the reason was that the payment i chose to make through klarna was not confirmed but on the contrary was announced that it had not been implemented therefore i chose paypal instead where the payment was clarified and confirmed that it was implemented some time later i was able to state that the order through payment with klarna actually went through in which i had actually carried out two orders paypal 24004374895 and klarna 24004374830 it does not feel good that the uncertainty of ordering arises when paying through klarna this has caused me an extra work that is not proportionate to ordering a hair trimmer they had been better i realize afterwards to go directly to the store i still want to point out that the people were nice in their treatment of me but it does not always help ;irritated

 agent could have answered the question more efficiently rather than chatting my connection was timed out because of the delay in answering ;irritated
 the first information regarding the suspected malfunction of the device was in my experience you should first watch the device a little most of the time it will work later ? after i was an electrical engineer myself and worked in the service for about 45 years i could not accept this answer see chat history moreover i was only able to mediate my problem with a few recursion loops now that i've got a replacement device i realize that the new device behaves exactly like the old one i suspect that the functional description manual for manual operation is incorrect please recheck ;irritated

 have a better system that interacts with retailers your rep was obstructive and unhelpful the item was within warranty the retailer was happy to swap it your rep would not provide them with a return code it is a razor i had not been able to use it for several days he wanted me to send it back to you by the time that had happened and a desision had been made and it changed or repaired i would have had a full beard 
such bad service and attitude on the phone from your rep luckily the lady at argos cleveleys took control and replaced the item no questions so she gave excellent service 
it has also taken you several weeks to send me this survey which shows how slowly you work i would probable still be waiting for a replacement at the speed you have gone very poor indeed ;irritated
answers give specific questions such was the scam which led to nothing ;irritated
in every way answering emails is a good start and also answering the language i have written on now i got an answer in english and this one had not understood my problem so i didn't get an answer to my question either ;irritated

 the person we spoke to didn  t have a very good understanding of english we found it frustrating to keep repeating ourselves 
also we feel you should of honoured the guarantee if a product is guaranteed for 2 years you expect the product to last at least 2 years this left us feeling that you do not expect your product to last 2 years we won ;irritated

 looking for a spare part for a device that i bought 2  years ago and that is still being sold therefore it amazes me already that you can get after such a short time no more essential sp service partners charge for the essay 13 euros and also still 6 50 euros shipping costs the device itself cost only 35 euros please excuse the irony but to pay more than half the purchase price for a piece of plastic is really a nonsense then i can just as well buy a new device with new warranties however i will then just look at the competition if philips so little emphasis on the sustainable use of their products i find that pretty disappointing ;irritated

 i got a toothbrush as a present for christmas unfortunately past experience tells me that electric toothbrushes and me don't mix i've had two and in each case my dentist told me my gums were receding 

so i wanted to return it unfortunately when i tried that i was told that because of the gdpr i had to get the person who bought it to return it after some haggling with customer service i was told i just needed to get my brother to agree then it could be returned i did this 

at the moment i'm waiting for a refund which will presumably go to my brother which will take 14 business days after delivering looking at the shipment 

https: www ups com track?loc=en_gb&tracknum=1z9v788x9190981197&requester=wt trackdetails

it seems like this will be 14 days after the 16th january the deadline for this survey is 04 02 2019 ie i won't know if the refund has come before the survey expires 

so i'm going to give a negative review on this survey because i won't know whether or not the refund happened at the time i give the survey 

sorry about this i'm actually something of a fan of philips and their products and even worked for a while at philips in eindhoven but the whole gdpr nonsense having to go back to the person who bought a gift to get approval to return it and the 14 business days for a refund has put me off significantly 

like i say sorry but that's the way it is ;irritated
it would have gone much faster than two months to get a home delivered instruction from the purchase it took several weeks between your feedbacks then when the copy user manual comes the text is so small that it is unreadable which it also became when i tried to print it myself through your website you do good stuff but this service was nothing but really lousy ;irritated

i have tried to register an azur performer plus iron which i purchased from amazon your site does not acknowledge that you produce steam irons of any description the number on it is nl9206ad 4 the site does not acknowledge this either i am pleased with the iron and have purchased another from your online shop for my grand daughter ;irritated
i have tried several times in contact with you to send back a steamer that i bought to my son in christmas gift he did not want but received several questions if i want to send back the goods what i want is a return ticket but it has not arrived strange procedure the last time it was one who wrote to me in english and probably didn't understand what i meant and then i'm still pretty shark in the english language how difficult it should be this has been pouring on late 27 12 2018;irritated

 warranty i am of the opinion that all devices should be displayed with the respective warranty whether extended or not after the slogan all philips devices at a glance ok maybe i am also from a time when many things have been questioned and not everything accepted as it is if it could be better with little effort ersatzscherfolie problem of the designation for me this is a ersatzscherkpof inkl folie that's why my question is how the head is changed in the meantime i have solved it myself and the pictures were not very helpful ;irritated
in my case the answer from the customer service representative shows that their really friendly and eager front end employees are being let down by the mentioned areas it would be helpful if philips knew what philips knows the device hd5408 70 is not a multi voltage device according to repair documents so if you buy it in europe it will not work in countries with 110v volt voltage as it has 220 240v that's what i knew and that's why i called about the equipment in costa rica we can unfortunately give no information i'm sorry you are welcome to inquire about local customer service it was not about costa rica but about where i can buy a device with the same brewing that works on 110 volt basis ;irritated

 our local branch of boots does not stock replacement heads 
i attempted to buy new brush heads directly from philips but was told that i would have to purchase them online
it is difficult to find out which toothbrush heads fit which toothbrush from the medley of brush heads on your website but during a phone call your representative told me that i needed sonicare proresults standard sonic toothbrush heads hx6014 26 

i attempted to order a pack of hx6014 26 online but when i entered my postcode i was informed that you did not deliver to my postcode pa34 4se

i telephoned philips again and your representative helpfully offered to assist with the order form 

there were 3 problems with this 
1 my name is mrs joan kemp but the title 'mrs' is missing from the drop down list of titles
2 the space for 'house number' does not allow space for a house name we do not have a house number 
3 when i filled in the post code i received the message we cannot deliver to this postal code area 

so i now have a philips electric toothbrush i cannot use because philips will not supply replacement heads either online or directly 

i intend to pass this report onto the uk consumer magazine 'which' as i think that selling an electric toothbrush for which you cannot obtain replacement heads is totally unacceptable 

as a corollary philips customer service telephoned me and have kindly offered to send me a pack of replacement heads for my sonicare toothbrush however this is not a solution to the problem of being unable to buy replacement parts from a retail outlet such as boots or order replacement parts either directly or online ;irritated

your call takers dont speak very good english i argued & argued to a manager on the phone she was most put out she had to walk a flight of stairs to come to the phone really i bought the iron from phillip's so that's who should replace it took days of arguing sending photos to your messenger service then when i sent photos it was can you send again never will i ever buy anything from you abortion company i ended up buying a tefal iron as i'm not going through this again & the compensation from you was a losey cleaning stick that cleans the bottom of the iron if anything gets stuck to it so ;irritated
it would have been good quick and clear reaction instead of me with reminders for a product that i have sent back for 2 weeks and you have received to sekieren ;irritated
was put through to approx 4 people and had to repeat the story each time;irritated
faulty product was returned with receipt and my details i made an online enquiry after one month as i had heard nothing philips either did not receive the product or they did receive it but chose to ignore the return regardless i will never buy a philips product ever again ;irritated
employ people who speak english fluently;irritated
when first purchased the product we registered the product with yourself but when we had to contact you for a repair you told us you had no record this has also happened to other people we know is it so you can charge for repair ?;irritated
 a standard recommendation descaling after 4 weeks of use i can not understand we have the model several times within the family and the last copy is so absurdly loud and takes forever for the brewing process ;irritated
better information and communication better organization between logisitkdienstleister and me as a customer client ;irritated
just listened to my story;irritated
my specific request was not addressed instead wrong arguments were communicated ;irritated
respond to my request answer my questions concerns read my mails and do not act stupidly for an inappropriate prozess simply annoying ;irritated
show you at all had helped me so this would have been a great improvement took weeks to months between each answer ;irritated
iron has been repaired approximately 4 times and it has stopped working again there is an obvious design fault with the iron and phillips need to accept this and replace the iron altogether;irritated
more knowledgeable support and faster response spent an hour with phone support without results then it took 1 2 weeks between the replies by mail the end result was that you could not replace my brand new and never used baby guard ;irritated
i felt disrespected;irritated
my order was cancelled after being paid for at checkout emailed and told technical issue new discount voucher would be sent email didn't arrive had to phone email raised manually as automated email system not working now no emailed order confirmation make sure your systems actually work very unhappy customer waited six weeks for irfryer to come back in stock ;irritated
i still don  t have the replacement charger and wonder if it  s ever going to arrive? your representative also tried to suggest i would ;irritated
 by agreeing to swap without delay when i made the first contact a good jug to replace the dangerous jug supplied originally 
the quality control was phillips responsibility ;irritated
 answer the actual question that i ask without me having to repeatedly ask it 4 separate times admit that i am
getting very sub standard service and font repeat things to me as if i am retarded massive waste of time and huge disappointment in your sub standard product and service ;irritated
not trying to fob me off in the first instance and treating me like an idiot i do know how to use a toothbrush and how it should sound ;irritated
your representative was very helpful but i was trying to source a replacement cable for my oneblade shaver and this was not possible in the uk  i wasted money buying a 3rd party cable which didn  t fit and then i sourced a cable in germany  actually it would have been better quicker and easier to have bought a ;irritated
of course things go wrong it  s how your response goes that  s key only way to get a quick resolution was chat service so off we go with helpful advisor then after about 15 mins of dialogue the system stops due to my inactivity when the advisor had asked me to wait so we start all over again sending screenshots and explaining the issue from scratch to a new advisor after much deliberation she said she  d have to get back to me by email after speaking to higher authority that took a week and the issue was resolved as suspected the problem was your website thank you the main issue is the time it to;irritated
i complained that a refund wasn't available for a faulty iron and was therefore passed to a second more senior representative who was able to authorize this in addition she told me that the replacement iron offered to me by my first contact was in fact no longer available i posted the faulty iron as requested the same day but have yet to receive my cheque ;irritated
solve the problem eg ;irritated
the first agent hung up on me as i didn't type quickly enough the second agent simply wasted my time ;irritated
the whole process is overly complex i have had multiple failures with these products there is no acknowledgement of this no sense that you are seeking to put it right by way of compensation i was offered a 15% money off voucher for a company that i have lost faith in on top of this the warranty starts from the day of purchase and not receipt of the replacement given that i have had the same problem with a number of them this is hardly helpful ;irritated
you do not have a spare part for an even newer razor;irritated
 we bought an iron from john lewis brent x who informed us that for an additional 10 15 we could insure iron against accidental damage they explained that we would need to do this through philips when i phoned you i was told that you knew nothing of this and that it must have been a special john lewis offer they however insist that it is your offer i have just spoken to maria who again told me that you know nothing of this matter it surprised me that i had to tell her in that case she had better phone john lewis brent x as they were doing something in your name that surely you would wish to know about i told her to phone j l and come back to me i am still waiting also when registering my iron online i did not know which number on the iron there were so many stickers attached and so had to phone philips might i suggest that you add a sticker which in large letter says registration number this might save your customers time also i have had no confirmation of my iron registration i expected an email from you confirming for a company of your size and age i am surprised at the number of things that have gone wrong i am not too sure about your slogan innovation and use my phone number is 0771 253 2111 hilary kashden ;irritated
promise as you can do almost a month i got hell of you the staff were well kept but i didn't get it as you promised the air purifier would be much more expensive for me plus i paid for a healthier visit you can get better when between out sales and sales work and do not hit the customer ;irritated
a specialist for coffee machines gets my call and should answer me questions about a hot air fryer airfryer xl that can not work but i could not be angry with her employee because of his enormous willingness and kindness ;irritated
better to respond to customer requests not interpret product warranty in favor of philips;irritated
at my request a close ;irritated
i found it very good that i received feedback after two days however i did not look in my mailbox for some time and jz my process has been considered completed  please a little more time ;irritated
tell us how the return policy works before you buy it would have saved effort nerves and money ;irritated
respond to the customer's request and send no standardized emails already grotesque the customer expects competent answers and the company philips overburdens the customer instead of answers with tasks  ;irritated
listened to what i said;irritated
as a result i am very satisfied except for a single statement regarding the use of the charger daily because an obtion of the device is that it should be usable after full charge up to 3 weeks otherwise very fast and unbureaucratic responds many thanks ;irritated
actually helped me totally useless;irritated
compensated financially and taken the product back ;irritated
take responsibility for errors made at the factory;irritated
everything;irritated
it was irritating that the last message answered my question conclusively and positively but the day before i had asked about another device and had received a hundred percent contrary answer ;irritated
standby your faulty products;irritated
actually i did not get the answer to my question maybe read the questions a bit more ;irritated
being really interested in the shaving performance of my shaver instead a 40% discount was offered to get a new one why would i buy a new one because i had no guarantee that the quality level of your products would have been better now in order to get clarity as to whether the razor i bought was a bad individual or if your quality level has generally deteriorated i ordered philips bulk items online surprise surprise the blades cut perfectly therefore my conclusion is that the razor i purchased was so called monday is a piece where for some reason there were blades capable of performing completely inappropriately my belief in philips' quality was back but i nevertheless missed my pleasure ;irritated
the lady on the phone should let me finish and be friendly instead of insulting me in the e mail my question about the weight of the toothbrush should have been answered i am very disappointed feel ill treated and could not clarify my question ;irritated
i received the device via amazon without any description only loud warnings in many languages in addition a picture book with which one can play riddle rates i would be very pleased about a clear and clear description in german language and a readable guidance ;irritated
have a better website now it was double order that it on the website stated that the purchase did not go through the return process was also very lumpy 1 had to get help from an acquaintance who works at philips to find phone numbers for service 2 talked to one from service at 08 four e mail later and at 12 i finally had the return tickets that i had to print from an unclear upc page and bring me back to the delivery point other suppliers have a return note in the package upon delivery ;irritated
not only ask but also give feedback on my answer i feel totally pissed off ;irritated
get more involved with the customer's problem work more solution oriented and see that ups shipping labels are filled in with the right city so that the packages are not returned and the customer has three times as much work and hassle before being sent the new product also it can not be that the customer has to wait for a vacuum cleaner for 400  which was already broken from the first minute until the vacuum cleaner comes back to you because your staff were too incapable of getting the right shipping label issue since it is the least that the new vacuum cleaner is sent out immediately regardless of whether you have received;irritated
the lady on the phone was extremely gracious and helpful but it takes more than a week to tell me what it costs to attach a new cable to the iron that's more than irritating and then it's still not fixed ;irritated
i got asked an awful lot of questions that meant you're collecting information about me without helping me then the online chat cut out while i was replying then it takes four days for an e mail response to my query which doesn't really help me at all really not impressed ;irritated
the whole experience was shocking and i made allowances given i work for philips the order process started in august 2018 but was not resolved until jan 2019 lack of communication at times constant chasing via phone & e mail by myself not a great customer experience at all ;irritated
answer the information i ask you;irritated
you could have acknowledged that your sonicare products have a persistent fault that causes premature failure and offered a replacement;irritated
i received a malfunctioning product and no indication for replacement absurd;irritated
been able to answer the question and answered within 14 days  ;irritated
i wanted to cancel an order but was told to wait to receive it first highly annoying ;irritated
conversely babyphone had not been bought even half a year yet it's true the device fell out of my hand i said that myself was honest there are no spare parts i did not know would not have chosen for philips ;irritated
the customer should also be treated as a customer and if you have a shortage of a product philips should stand for it and not pose as a cosmetic problem that is not covered by the guarantee a lack is a defect ;irritated
you should still offer spare parts for devices that you still sell  ;irritated
make sure people do what they are supposed to do and respond to the cases you receive ;irritated
by delivering the product that i ordered for express on time;irritated
sort out your refund process;irritated
you should have read my mail in this mail i told you that my coffee machine is already at your service for repair her answer was i could ask you for conversion or exchange of the device and should attach to it a letter without a letter to the device  the device is already with you the answer was therefore very close to it ;irritated
the product i wanted spare part was not possible to obtain ;irritated

the customer service was fine only the philosophy of philips we find sad that you get for a device after 1 5 years no spare parts and you are forced to throw away society unfortunately this is not the first time that we do not get a spare part for philips devices after a short time 1 2years lifetime ;neutral

it was incredibly difficult to get in touch with the right department then i think it was difficult to describe the problem in english instead of swedish was questioned whether the problem really existed when i finally got hold of a person who could help me i got good help but it took at least 5 attempts i do not understand why one cannot get a maildress for a customer service ? sitting in live chat and writing in english or talking to others by phone in norwegian or english is not good service according to me however i got good help finally but then i was already really annoyed ;neutral
 i explained in my initial contact that i didn't have a receipt for my curler and i was told that wouldn't be a problem you would just need the numbers on it three weeks later i was asked for the receipt so took longer than i thought acceptable i would have preferred a replacement item instead of a cheque but wasn't offered a choice i was pleased after having asked for it that i was e mailed a postal label in order to return the item i think having a knowledgeable person dealing with queries would have helped i wouldn't have had to chase my query ;neutral

 the customer services assistant in athens was first class but the head office did not follow up with the call as suggested my sister had a hand mixer which broke down last year but it was over 50 years ago i thought you  d be pleased to hear about this and a good story for your executive branch your follow up email dated 12 12 did not seem to grasp the purpose of my call at all all you needed to write was  thank you for your call to our call centre and we are very pleased to hear that your sister  s philips hand mixer lasted for over 50 years we pride ourselves in good and long lasting products at philips and the mixer is a great example of this we will pass your comments on to head office as i  m sure they  ll be delighted as we are to hear that your sister was a satisfied customer for so many years as a token of good faith we are offering you a 15% discount on any future pservices response to my telephone call and would have matched the excellent service i had from the lady who took my call

wanted product was not found on the recommended website ;neutral
do not give the impression that to solve the problem you are reading the instruction manual because otherwise nothing is done more than what the consumer could already do ;neutral
satisfaction guarantee pages could have been better designed as it was then i got a model that was not included in the satisfaction guarantee sadly if i bought it and then after 30 days tried to use the satisfaction guarantee the person i was chatting with was understanding and returned with information that the product was not at all in the satisfaction guarantee he would also report so the page became less confusing luckily i wanted to check before buying ;neutral
i called and after a short time and i dropped the line and they no longer contacted me plus i called back but in english they told me to call back after a few days ;neutral
by improving your web site to make it easier to register products on line and giving an easy option to register products by phone it was not easy to find how to contact someone when i had a problem trying to do things on line when i did manage to contact someone i did not always understand her english she did resolve my problem eventually the next day but on the day of contacting her i was left frustrated with the service ;neutral
was ok;neutral

if you promise something to the customer should the customer also get what you are doing is pure foolhardy;neutral

during the call i was made aware that my device is an older model since i am in and of itself but happy you do not have to complain about the age;neutral
your people are wonderful the lady with whom i have been communicating repeatedly about the problem i have is excellent in all of her a man to work in such a big company on the contrary philips for my coffee maker which destroyed the marble bench in the kitchen and has a problem needs service in the warranty ie the coffee maker you think is new yet will leave me at least 2 weeks without a coffee machine therefore as much money as i have bought i will definitely give out coffees besides i'm going to go out and to get some coffee i have to go with the car so i'll probably recycle it and i'll get another one i am not covered by philips' warranty terms i keep only the terrible with the lady's service and thank her very much ;neutral

come directly to the goal;neutral
that's okay ;neutral
everything was ok;neutral
the basic evil was already due to the operating instructions which was beautifully equipped with pictures but did not contain any explanatory words ;neutral

think it is completely wrong to have to pay for the freight yourself when you use your 60 day trial offer then you must not return the package in the store either  crazy;neutral
make your website more user friendly as it won't take address details properly such as property with a house name ;neutral
solve the problem with product registration i just sent the negative message to your support with the purchase invoice for the product and asked to register the product i hope that will happen ;neutral
at the moment i feel satisfied with the service of the operator because he has solved my problem;neutral
the iron gc9620 20 delivered on 10 16 18 for repair  i was finally replaced yesterday but with another model the gc9405 80  the service center has assured me that this is a more recent model but with equal characteristics compared to mine  now i have to try it but i would like to have confirmation from you that it is exactly the same thing as performance compared to the previous one which i had chosen based on the best purchase reported by altroconsumo ;neutral

nothing;neutral
i got an answer took some time guess it was due to the weekends;neutral
an earlier feedback would have been nice i have made it to the feedback to me about another provider to obtain a replacement although the article is very difficult to get and this additionally sent ;neutral
directly to my problem do not try to ramble of 5 employees of them in the after sales service only one has recognized my problem but my spare part problem could not really be solved because this one does not exist anymore then another one had bought and my main unit was converted now everything is fine ;neutral
anything;neutral
the request individual or personal answer i asked for presentations from your pastamaker near my place of residence and was referred to presentations on the internet most of which i know by now since there are different variants of the product i still do not know whether for me a device with weighing function is better or not which noodle matrices i actually need if the penne are really as thick as in some reviews if the device mainly made of plastic and partly leaves a lot of dough  in the shop i have to be lucky if the sellers know your product from practice and of course would be very satisfied with a presentation with possibility for further inquiries i also do not necessarily want to order a product and send it back if i do not like it that's why i prefer my noodles as well as ever which is cheaper and really handmade ;neutral
be sure to handle the customer's mail inbox more efficiently so that the customer does not have to wait more than 14 days for a message ;neutral
not many items are available on the website;neutral
chat could be smoother by the way it was a matter of fact and kindness but this time it was stubborn and both the person and the language changed i had to explain it again the result lasted a long time and ended up having to explain the matter to the customer service person of the sales office once more eventually i returned the device got my money back and bought my rival product instead ;neutral
nothing;neutral

the service is efficient i have no advice;neutral

no comment;neutral
my damage was not resolved;neutral
better information about torque in service from start to finish every step in the process of resolving the case took a very long time whether it was just slow or it was also unnecessarily cumbersome and inflexible ;neutral
problem was not solved;neutral
it's all right;neutral
it took a long time to get a replacement product because they were over got the question if i could imagine another color which was nice sometimes it took a long time to get answers to my emails and some answers failed in any case it finally resolved even if it took a long time ;neutral

provide that the instruction manual is more comprehensive regarding the coding of faults and possible solutions;neutral
settlement is too complicated;neutral
i repeated the same phrases and questions i had already posted the three day promised contact with the customer service really did not come true ;neutral
the chat that offer has problems i have never been able to expose the problem because it did not open the keyboard at least x can write the text;neutral
i'm satisfied with the service;neutral
i did not have a problem with the service;neutral
helpful but not very accommodating;neutral
to charge such a large amount for a replacement battery worth a few cents is not right ;neutral
it would have been good if spare parts were not only available to the service workshop but also sold so i helped with tinkering ;neutral
that's okay;neutral
that's okay;neutral

made right from the start i had to wait many weeks and after having had contact with 3 different people at you before solving a new toothbrush for warranty in addition i have already filled in a questionnaire where i signaled my dissatisfaction without getting any feedback whatsoever as i have understood your support service there seems to be a lot to work with  now i raised my grade from irritated to neutral because i finally got a new brush;neutral
sent a replacement correct product since it was purchased due to incorrect information on the philips website;neutral

one could have given me a better information i'm still waiting for feedback to see if my coffee machine has arrived and for my refund ;neutral
with your own service;neutral
my problem that the dripping pan is not properly clean neither by hand nor in dishwasher is not solved the missing recipe book is obviously on the way but not yet arrived it is pointed to a lid that is too small for my device when the available for my device is not answered ;neutral
selling spare parts to your equipment;neutral
the phone connections were very bad i had to repeat my address and the damage several times 10 15x very tedious the solution was not as i imagined ;neutral
your sales rep was very helpful but your checkout website is poor it was not easy to navigate and follow the progress of my purchase it kept sending me back to repeat steps for no reason also it rejected my address and i had to put in a fake extra line before it would let me proceed ;neutral
slow response;neutral
i would have liked a quicker solution i was waiting for news that i asked for;neutral
show more goodwill;neutral
it was not directly related to my message of the program received but the neutral answer sent which simply did not fit on the problem encountered especially with my device since my messages were different as described in their answer ;neutral
update us on refunds and it being process after receiving good back currently have no idea when or if will be process soon even through you have item back;neutral
one would have been able to read my questions correctly and not answer the first answer which might fit ;neutral
quicker response sent the right item out first time & sorted the problem;neutral
a useful instruction manual can't see in the instructions what the different signatures mean where i set the temperature ;neutral
that you could get the back accessory ;neutral
the guy i spoke to was very welcoming and knowledgable but what i essentially wanted wasn't possible so i ended up purchasing from a different website ;neutral
the service was exhaustive;neutral
easier identification of part i was after along with a part number and have it in stock;neutral
unfortunately no correct information;neutral
when the cell phone was viewed by philips it was no longer possible to return to chat so the chat ended;neutral
anything an excellent service and courtesy ;neutral
the help was fine but the part i needed wasn't available ;neutral
you couldn't;neutral
that's okay;neutral
the contact was nice but unfortunately the spare part was not available ;neutral
it is very complicated until the customer of philips products comes to the right place for the repair request very questionable for such a big company think about switching to other branded products ;neutral
a detailed description of what has now been exactly made would be nice i had complained three parts and have now received an info that the defective accessory was ordered and assume that it is a ready made answer because unfortunately i do not know what is being sent exactly new and what with the others defective parts mr becker from the telephone contact was very polite and tried to help me there is nothing to complain about ;neutral
listened;neutral
i am disappointed with the quality of the philips products and the effort to get information on how the returns policy works the website and the product range of philips devices too cluttered high expenditure of time to compare the individual philips electric toothbrushes batteries last up to 2 years and then the warranty is over already done several times goodwill reimbursement too low ;neutral
greater staff preparation;neutral
improve accessibility;neutral
do not outsource the spare parts ;neutral
it was not your fault ;neutral
a it would be advantageous if my original request were included in your reply mail b unfortunately my questions were answered incompletely and my renewed demand i have not received a reply c i find your website in view of the variety of products which sometimes only marginally different unhelpful to find the most suitable electric toothbrush for me for this i would like to ask for a small list of questions which at the end filters out the products that are suitable for me and perhaps then explains to me exactly what they are different from ;neutral
by your on line system allowing me to give a uk delivery address and a jersey channel islands billing address ;neutral
the link for b2b customers does not work we can not register;neutral
i was looking for the mg7720 case but it is not available;neutral
better offer regarding goodwill regulation ;neutral
i found the 15 minutes wait a bit too long it should not be more than five minutes ;neutral
sometimes a customer needs more time to respond to the mail of the service maybe my request for the coffee machine was not accurate enough kind regards;neutral
the service fee for after warranty troubleshooting is disproportionately high ;neutral
keep promise from the time of the feedback ;neutral
your customer service is perfectly fine i was annoyed more by other things the complexity of the registration and the many emails that did not come from the customer service this questionnaire i do now for the 3rd time that you have to upload the account when registering for example is unnecessary because without a bill i would have no extended warranty anyway there are so many steps that you lose your pleasure in between and prefer to forego the extended warranty your personal customer service however is super class and really trying to help  ;neutral
can take care of my concerns without the rumeleefonieren me now;neutral

really help instead of building devices that simply break from one day to the next;neutral
the on line chat person was very helpful and pleasant but the problem i have is that i simply wanted to register my appliance and the website did not offer a user friendly access to this i now have to wait until my grandson is free to help me follow the process provided by your assistant i donot have a receipt as the air purifier was a present so i need to find out how to photo graph the serial number and then upload it to the computer in order to send it to you i wish the process was as easy as it used to be when we received a registration form in the post or with the instruction manual so easy to fill in and so quick then in an envelope and pop it in the post so slick it would help enormously if this method was reinstated ;neutral
be able to send warranty certificates or have been more helpful in how to do when a product is broken more than to turn to dealers ;neutral
by taking the phone on it no that was handed out which is 35444134 has tried several times;neutral

i had a problem with my coffee machine the man at the hotlein could not help me and promised me that i would get a callback from a technician during the day at most 3 to 4 hours and this may possibly give me tips in solving the problem unfortunately i'm still waiting for the callback my coffee machine is working again thank you for your effort greetings sebastian g ;neutral
increase the web chat;neutral
for example forward directly to the online shop ;neutral
it is about a device which is used for the safety of a child it obviously does not work anymore since the software update we all customers would expect to get presented a solution faster since these devices are not very cheap ;neutral
your agent was fine but your webpage for registering your product is poor in terms of the information it asks for and the actual information you can input it is also not clear when you click the help as to where or what your serial number is ;neutral
the chat was canceled i did not receive an answer to my last question;neutral

nothing more than what you did;neutral
i was informed that i will receive a next model of my toothbrush handle but i wasn  t honored that new model it would have been really nice to try another;neutral
i should send everything only in the course of the conversation and persuasion the ma realized that it is easier with the submission of info photos including what worked after all basically i am about the accessibility information on the status everything can take longer info helps to understand and possibly accept and of course the satisfactory processing excited so philips always remains my manufacturer when the decision is on the loose makes even better products and above all keep the service mfg m piontek ;neutral
now i only got a new address that might solve the case ?? i had expected that the transfer could have happened internally so that i got a concrete feedback ;neutral

first of all you should set the phone number for the actions correctly i tried 2 days and nothing worked about the phone number with 040  i continued and the employee has taken my data very friendly i get in touch with the 100 pad action and send my receipt with data for the refund mfg barbara berndt;neutral
when you put a product on the market you must also give the recipe book and possibly in italian ;neutral
make it possible to learn more about the technical characteristics and use of the products;neutral
i very much was happy with the quick delivery and the replacement of the teats which were originally sent damaged in transit due to the lack of packaging & care given in transit i was sent a free dummy and a pack of 2 bottles the dummies will be of use thank you very much but the bottles are from your classic range which i won't be using as the teats are for your natural range which i prefer i don't mean to be moany as the replacements were quick coming next day and i was very pleased with that service given i was just disappointed when i was told i would be given a few extra bits for the arrival of my twins and the bottles are of no use to me thank you regardless ;neutral
firstly by understanding and reading the question in the first place i asked about a shaver warranty fo a shaver that was a gift and got a response about electric toothbrushes then the suggestion was made to go to a photographer to get a photo taken of the shaver given the cost and then the problem of how to submit a photo struck me as discrimination against elderly people and those who are not computer literate eventually it was sorted but should not have been an issue iun the first place ;neutral
maybe more customer attention;neutral
i have ordered fc6904 01 and i do not understand why i am informed by phone about the delay of the delivery and now order the item again ;neutral

 well the answer did not help me much i need an adapter for the whisk and the customer service sends me a picture of a whisk adapter unit what do i have to order now?;neutral
my question feedback was perhaps not standard so i wanted to send a pic as attachment a normal email service would have suited better than live chat the live chat response was satisfactory but i don  t feel i was able to convey my disappointment in the level of unnecessary packaging through live chat and consequently the response was  we will pass your feedback on  it may get passed on it may not but with such little detail i doubt my comments will make a difference and this is a big issue philips should ;neutral

on the demand what the error message meant was given in retrospect the wrong answer the symbol says that the coffee grounds container is full this symbol is not in the manual furthermore you should not empty the coffee grounds container in between which is also not correct when the device is on the device should remember it that the coffee grounds container has been emptied otherwise i was in other contacts but very happy with the statements such as sonicare  ;neutral

faster feedback on my question since i needed the info to the exact dimensions urgently i put the question at the end with amazon under the article and received directly several answers ;neutral
make a product that even if it has the function vacuum cleaner for carpets allows you to do it without ruining them aspiration too also in the x armchairs function it is too powerful and sucks all the wool fleece the carpet sticks to the vacuum cleaner even if dictated to a minimum ;neutral
my contacts with your hotline were totally disappointing details can be tracked in the recording of the conversations;neutral
first make sure it was a danish speaking person and not an english speaking person and if the person could have solved my problem then it would have been perfect ;neutral
 you couldn't the lady done her absloute best i myself needed a much simpler method of restrising

one knew too little about the device;neutral
the problem of the registration could not be solved because my pc did not allow the online registration i use windows 7 with firefox or ms internet explorer but it was not possible to register the creation of a customer account glared via smartphone but even with this product registration was not possible ????;neutral
the technical problem of your device should have been solved i could not be helped ;neutral
all right;neutral
telephone accessibility terrible suggestions for improvement should be possible ;neutral
i can already give 1 tpps;neutral
checking your products before placing them on the market it is unacceptable to buy a new product and not to work ;neutral
show alternatives ;neutral
more ways to solve my problem it was immediately suggested that i send the defective device but i had already done that and would have had to pay for further submissions i would have preferred to have more alternative suggestions which you can try to solve the problem yourself;neutral
explain better to the service center what the piece they sold to me for a different use also convinced of my second visit complaining about the malfunction;neutral
except for my mistakes i did not receive any conclusive answer regarding my report so i did not understand if the product i purchased had a problem or not as proof of my report i provided what was requested and i was sent free 1 blade i reported having problems with a batch of 3 blades but i did not understand if the product had a problem or not and if indeed the problem was recognized by you you should send me 3 blades instead of those purchased by me and not 1 or you should have given me at least one negative answer ;neutral
the item i purchased manual pump was missing a piece which meant i could not use it until a new piece was sent to me i would have been happy to receive compensation for the hassle such as a milk storage cup or spare bottle ;neutral
communicate with customers ;neutral
immediately to answer my questions and not only after asking again ;neutral
better conditions more flexibility the funds provided to customer service are very limited answers take a long time but it is expected almost an immediate response from the customer;neutral
the query was about a filter for a vacuum cleaner but you were thanked for the question of espresso filters copy paste went wrong the inquiry could have been avoided if the website had worked the link referring to a reseller does not show a reseller ;neutral
speed;neutral
the people i spoke to were very helpful but your website and product line up is very confusing i was sent a link to the product i wanted but lots of other stuff appeared on the same page and was very confusing;neutral
you helped me well was disappointed with your delivery agent ups;neutral
 little or nothing to my question exists or there is not a container of oil inox it would have been enough for me or no you gave me further news that i already knew i use sunflower oil and substituted it often every 2 or 3 fritture however the problem remains that the oil above the level of liquid for heat is thick and it is very difficult to remove it  if the container were in stainless steel as in all professional and semi professional fryers with a little straw the problem would be solved the non stick coating is not non sticking  ;neutral
i bought a philips coffee machine special offer at the end of 2018 until today i have not received the articles of the special offer after registration the lady wanted to take care of it and i should get an email unfortunately there is no settlement in this regard ;neutral
everything ok ;neutral
at the time i decided to go for a toothbrush sparaboo the first time this was done automatically the delivery was canceled after several phone calls then the delivery was triggered with the note that it should really happen automatically from then on now in january the delivery was again out although the portal of the delivery date was displayed correctly it is disappointing that this offered auto delivery service is a great idea so badly implemented there is still room for improvement here ;neutral
if you had the same price as other suppliers i had traded with you but your price was 25% higher than with another supplier why i had bought from them upon contact with your ang there were only cases in your case but it would cost as much in shipping as the case price you offered a discount but it was so time when i already bought if i had known it before i could have bought both items from you and got everything free of charge now i will be without a case would have been practical eg when traveling ;neutral
answer faster i still have not received any ;neutral
less always the same things to discuss with each always the complete name and address incl email to check the data call is annoying ;neutral
will;neutral
faster response to my question ;neutral
unfortunately i could not be helped i would like to register my device for a 3 year warranty the internet address given on the membership card included in the box www philips com myshaverseries5000 does not work download 1000 manuals ;neutral
you should have honoured my first order and not cancelled it ;neutral
checked mail more often ;neutral
restore my wanted item ;neutral
manuals not only illustrated by photos but with written descriptions;neutral
i received a 30% discount on your website which contains an infinitesimal fraction of the products you sold  so useless and unused if you make a present in the face of an inconvenience caused by you at least do it right ;neutral
offer a handpiece for the toothbrushes as a spare part the customer service however can not help that this is not yet on the market ;neutral
everything ok;neutral
by quick action ;neutral
took a long time to arrive missing the 30% discount i was promised because of the stray therese laweby therese laweby@gmail com;neutral
all good;neutral
by telephone i was asked the same operations reported in the booklet;neutral
i  m not convinced my problem was answered a red flashing light has always indicated that there is a problem if philips is rewriting the books then it should indicate so i;neutral
do not know ;neutral
i needed to contact you several times before i got an answer then took all the time long;neutral
i was forwarded to a workshop where i should give a number sent but no one could do something with it the workshop you do not get by phone sometime you have a secretary who can not connect may feedback then takes ;neutral
no longer remembered;neutral
that's okay;neutral
i could not be offered a necessary spare part if you sell items you should at least offer the necessary parts also references to repair workshop has brought no success ;neutral
it is extremely disappointing that philips has stopped manufacturing replacement filters for my kettle model hd4671 20 this means that i can no longer use a kettle which otherwise is in perfect working order instead i will have an additional expense of buying a replacement ;neutral
more technical and less generic answers;neutral
for a replacement within the warranty period two weeks to need speaks for itself this makes the company not really popular with me next time a brown again ;neutral
ddf;neutral
took some time to answer the response was straightforward but silly that phillips did not have spare parts available ;neutral
had to phone as i could not set up an account not your fault ;neutral
das that works with my email;neutral
it would be nice if you could offer me spare parts for repair ;neutral
able to repair shavers that are two years old;neutral

the service was ok possibly recommend another dental product that could enhance my dental needs;neutral
it was bought from amazon;neutral
nothing;neutral
more information about the products directly in connection with the product on the website got an answer when contacted which is good but maybe ineffective for your part ;neutral
the offer was unfortunately too expensive  i know that it is also cheaper therefore i do not make use of your offer and i apply to another provider wanted to order over the manufacturer  should be safer but not more expensive at the same time ;neutral
i dont know if my query has been resolved i have not received an email saying what is happening after i provided the required information ;neutral
by replacing the extremely fragile and easily damaged part free of charge i am apparently very far from being the only person to report this as a design fault instead it cost me over  14 via an;neutral
anything;neutral
longer warranty on hoses;neutral
it was a fast and friendly service unfortunately the answer did not help me any further maybe it's the written transmission of the problem i wrote of unusually much water accumulation in the drip tray and strong steam leakage the problem has already been solved the coffee machine has given back as it was obviously not in order ;neutral
i advertised a product service ok but complicated to complain ;neutral
be more precise where to find spare parts;neutral
i was satisfied if necessary i could have explained the distinction of the two toothbrush heads in more detail ;neutral
you are exhaustive but the question was trivial ;neutral
reply faster and if you answer then do not ask 3 times and get feedback i had a single question to answer now for the 3rd time  that can not be ;neutral
with the new device the drawer was not distorted now after one year of operation she has moved the support says that's normal for that i lack the understanding ;neutral
takes everything too long  ;neutral
immediately repair the machine properly the first time there is no compensation for all the circumstances caused by the improper handling of the first repair;neutral
nothing that's okay;neutral
send products that work when they break  i didn't want to have money instead;neutral
sold me something without a fault then i wouldn't need to contact you;neutral
faster handling of defective product;neutral
with faster service;neutral
i think that what i received was sufficient;neutral
understanding the 5 year warranty without the reg requirement on the website that did not appear at all during the purchase in the store;neutral
i am already aware that philips has many different product groups something more coffee machine specific expertise i would have liked in addition a local possibility for repair;neutral
the price of repair cost more than the iron when purchased;neutral
deliver better quality ;neutral
the receipt of the returned goods to 11 12 2018 was confirmed to me but i could not be informed of any information regarding the current state of the processing in the end i was with the statement again to wait two weeks fed the current processing status no matter in which system it is recorded should always be available ;neutral
the service was ok but the product's durability is poor which is why it has to deal with warranty issues ;neutral
nothing;neutral
that's okay;neutral
the device may replace the same since it is only 6 months old;neutral
waiting times between shorter answers;neutral
understand better;neutral
yes at the direct order of the spare part;neutral
guarantee faster delivery times for the product sent for repair;neutral
i think the expertise on the product was not very high;neutral
nothing is fine;neutral
kulanter und;neutral
i wanted to register a product and extend the warranty for another year and was really annoyed at first the registration did not work because of your system and then i was on the phone forever ;neutral

if there is no cash register left a customer can change that badly more about it;neutral
work a bit faster;neutral
nothing;neutral
paid too much amazon price 37 32 euros we did not receive a further 10% should be enclosed with the delivery not recommended yours sincerely j puls;neutral
the customer contact directly to the operating company would not be bad ;neutral
have been in contact with your customer service several times around the same problem super nice dialogue but we still have the same problems as from the beginning our one parent unit loses contact with the child unit sometimes 7 8 times a night the other works well we have tried everything you proposed ;neutral
by sending the discount voucher which was promised;neutral
i had to wait 3 weeks until i could use my 2 months young saeco coffee machine again because a part nipple worth about 10 cents had been lost i expected that they would have provided the part even for a fee their answer after a long time they wear the schukd if they lose the part this is not customer service ;neutral
it took a very long time and i got to hear from me in the same case 3 times before it hung anything it feels a bit boring ;neutral
i enjoyed it;neutral
nothing what you had to do was done unfortunately i did not solve the problem;neutral
the operator was very efficient but i think it is the manual of the vacuum cleaner that is too poor in the explanations a manual with words and more complete would be better thanks;neutral
the pre programmed answers or the way the ai replies feel well just insulting & cold feels as if a lot of time and effort went into making some of the replies as cringworthy as you possibly could;neutral
answer faster;neutral
perhaps suggested that i should disassemble the cutting heads i thought it was the battery but after trying to access the battery i went over to the cutting head and mounted everything apart that was where the error was full of hair that made the machine not work ;neutral
i wrote in english that the coffee machine i requested was not on the danish market slightly odd when i bought the danish owned chain skousen in denmark;neutral
that's okay;neutral
in my case it would have been nice if they offered spare parts separately;neutral
better respond to the questions answer back faster;neutral
my core question has not been answered why the boiling water only after 84sec visible in the glass jug my opinion is that the boiling water unnecessarily dehydrates because it unnecessarily lime is eliminated ;neutral
we have tried to complain about our registered product on the website this is so user unfriendly that we ultimately had to make the complaint by phone have you ever heard of usability? very bad ;neutral
nothing;neutral
answers to swedish as well as are real opinion on the issue ;neutral
reply by e mail;neutral
to have better knowledge to have answered the question more reassuringly or to pass me on to someone with better knowledge ;neutral
service good product was faulty twice and had to be replaced ;neutral
make the articles available;neutral
having spare parts brushes available for sensitive teeth when needed ;neutral
if i had all taken care of it at one time it would have been nice now i wait for another company to return the message ;neutral
telephone calls absolutely okay helpful and friendly for me the confusing variety of sonic toothbrushes leaves in my opinion hardly a decent basis for a purchase decision ;neutral
given me an airfryer;neutral
unfortunately information could not be given the lady had to contact the technical department and then responded within 2 days the information was not satisfactory ;neutral
improve chat which does not fall;neutral
my request was negative but friendly answered ;neutral
thank you i'm pretty disappointed because i always bought philips  but the last purchase gave me problems  my stretcher  immediately after i had to change the cable because it was a wrong game and now the steam does not come out completely  now it's in assistance  and i'll definitely have to buy another one  but i do not think to take and phillips;neutral
had expected that i would receive a proposal from philips and not only be forwarded to other companies ;neutral
to make the system easier let customers can cancel the order before it dispatched ;neutral
order process on the account 2 days not available  there is no order  no e mail to order  only after telephone contact tells me that the order has been received then the ups tracking number ;neutral
it took a month for you to reply and it was incredibly hard to find an online order correspondence email to write to you could have made it easier to contact you and then reply sooner ;neutral
i did not need support but only an information your consultant was quick to give me the answer i was looking for positive factor and at your service i give the vote of 7 thank you federica ;neutral
all good;neutral
wrong procedure when returning don't see why i couldn't just give the order number directly i was first asked to enter all my details name mail phone address etc and product number etc should you not get all the info with the order number?;neutral
faster response;neutral
the razor battery has stopped working after the warranty expires i got a 30% discount on the coupon online store although there was a 20% discount for everyone i can't buy a new device ;neutral
very good service;neutral
nothing;neutral
we are expecting a phone call to personally ask for a quote thank you;neutral
the site had no obvious place to go for buying spares so had to use chat the agent then provided a link which worked and the process completed from there so an obvious link would help a lot;neutral
show goodwill;neutral
 contact form on the website and do not need to ask via hotline completed contact form automatically as a copy to the customer email was requested at notify me also mail copy to customers ;neutral
the friendliness and please speak german ;neutral
good service nothing to complain about;neutral
i was given a link through to your kettles but it did not work;neutral
anything;neutral
not really better the statements were very honest but unfortunately a bit disappointing for us ;neutral
my bill at the time shows that she is in her system;neutral
for example pointing out alternative in my case the supplier could not help with a fussilli matrix to my device only after own search i could find a supplier of such adapters ;neutral
the service was good the answer just did not drive me ;neutral
the problem with the magnet which is located in the float of the product and do not generally answer because offering a complete water tank as an accessory to replace the magnet is not sustainable as the magnets rust it would be sensible to only offer these that was my concern but the mail was generally answered so the problem was not addressed ;neutral
had problems inserting my address in the end gave up ;neutral
better instructions directly on the website so i had managed the problem myself faster managed it myself after i signed up for the support but before that i got some answers your website is cluttered clearly state that no proof of purchase or receipt is needed when i register my product for the warranty rather register automatically everything that the customer bought in the webshop ;neutral
the device saeco sm7683 00 is one month old and the brewer is very stiff the brewer was greased as prescribed no improvement a herr von media markt has tested the brewer and found it very hakelig also in the test machine it was very loud on the phone from philips there was only the option to send the entire device an exchange of the brewer defective against new did not exist a device for over 1000  send in order to exchange a brewer for 60  in sales i can not understand here i would have liked a different solution the philips here such an effort and in this price range for me is not really understandable here the service is missing the employees on the phone have limited options as they work on instructions i can understand but that here on the first call after a device age of one month no other option is offered except to bring the device is not a satisfactory solution for me even sending a new brewer whom i would have paid myself was non the coffee machine industry i know how unhealthy that is to send back and forth for the machine from torsion of the machine to broken holders of components during transport anything would be possible and that for a brewer here you should first check which is the optimal solution for the customer and the device i would have wished and synonymous with a saeco device expected my also read that the service for saeco is different was also a purchase criterion for me nevertheless with a machine of over 1000 euros i'm not too bad and have bought a new brewer and lo and behold everything runs without sending in and a lot of fanfare what could have been better? here you should first check which is the optimal solution for the customer and the device here too let the customer service decide who is in direct contact with the customer and can better assess the situation here does the customer need help or does he just want a free second brewer if the customer here proposes a broken brewer for a new one or even wants to buy a new brewer and the service says he is not allowed to do it on the other hand as a customer even if this is the optimal service picking up the device on site is a great service but in my view the last option ;neutral
philips will be liable for defective products to the dealer and will not arrange for itself fortunately the dealer was quite cool ;neutral
quicker service;neutral
i did not find the spare part i was looking for because it was no longer available;neutral
the iron could have worked in the first place so i wouldn't have needed to return it ;neutral
nothing the lady was friendly and helpful ;neutral
i registered my mail but got no 20% discount code would have gladly received it susanne risberg@gmail com;neutral
i did not receive the promised toothbrushes this was part of the purchase of the electric toothbrush at saturn and even confirmed by letter from philips ;neutral
i think there is a customer service branch in vienna that can be reviewed when necessary and the repair like the rest of the companies in vienna does not have a customer service;neutral
a technician could have explained to me where the problem lies ;neutral
disappointed that nothing could be done other than retiring the steam generator;neutral
everything is alright;neutral
explain better online shopping;neutral
the chat service stopped several times technical problem the staff however once achieved was very friendly and pro active ;neutral
be more exhaustive;neutral
more and more akleren;neutral

the warranty claim was not updated in my philips profile and does not display correctly in discover my philips> all my products ;neutral
faster reaction times;neutral
i believe in the request you can only forward this & acutely nothing company ;neutral
free service for the first result;neutral
there was no solution from my side because i had already brought the device in question to the trash i am concerned with the basic procedures of your company which i do not feel consumer friendly and certainly not environmentally friendly ;neutral
not primarily from the manual but just give tips;neutral
the manual that came with my new shaver was awfull ;neutral
fast processing but undercooled;neutral
more interest in helping later i got some compensation ;neutral
talk in person or give me some reference number not just via chat;neutral
describe the error code found in the manual;neutral
probably as i had two conversations both giving me varying advice the 1st pretty unhelpful the second more helpful ;neutral
faster processing of the return;neutral
i have performed the recommended action many times de calcifying the iron with very limited effect very little debris or water comes out of the iron when it is being de calcified i feel there should be a better system for such an expensive item i didn't get back in touch though which i should have done as i have carried on repeating this ;neutral
write a reasonable manual in german i do not speak pictographically ;neutral
friendly service but i would have liked a bit more goodwill;neutral
i do not know  i have problems with your application but i do not think they are solvable ;neutral
timing the request took 30 minutes;neutral
i mentioned that this is the second fault within a week of the iron being fixed by yourselves and it has burnt my husbands shirt there was no offer of any compensation or even an apology for it;neutral
 by sending the package and providing a shipping date to ups i still have no reason to believe that something is happening now other than that kim and ole said don't worry ;neutral
customer service good repair of the device questionable;neutral
a better product description for wisp masks;neutral
for a technical question a call center employee is simply overwhelmed but a technician should contact me ;neutral
cheaper replacement for an item only two years old that cost over ;neutral
i got an answer can't see room for improvement;neutral
if i could of purchased so spare part for my iron ;neutral
just ;neutral
want to be able to call and speak my native language english;neutral
anything;neutral
it was a little harder to talk to someone who spoke nynorsk than it had been with a person who spoke swedish even though she was very nice and helpful ;neutral
you can make a cancellation button in the online shop and an order confirmation would also be great because i have not received until today ;neutral
no the staff were competent and everything worked until then unfortunately i have not heard anything since i've done everything i have certainly 2 weeks ago to return an article u would like to settle the remaining bill over klarna it's just too long ;neutral
hello unfortunately the machine has been returned and the coffee has tasted like water again no idea what it is you did not find the mistake one day later he tasted normal again for whatever reason everything is fine so far i hope it stays like this nevertheless many thanks for the service and lg britta brochhagen;neutral
faster resolution;neutral
better online order form;neutral
after requesting parts for my machine that stopped working i received nice mail about what had happened i answered the e mail with the sequence of events then i heard no more did not expect this to be on the warranty but could well have received an answer to my email ;neutral
no you couldn't everything was good;neutral
if you have been using a cpap device for several years already point out that there are innovative cpap device versions especially for flight trips without power supply from a socket using rechargeable battery operation ;neutral

it was a very general standard answer to this topic ;neutral
very nice employee technically not very competent the same information i can get about her homepage ;neutral

16 days have already passed since the return delivery money but not on the account ;neutral
no;neutral
although the final outcome was satisfactory it took a long time and a lot of effort on my part i think most people would have given up there was a switch of personnel at one point which effected continuity at no time did i feel i was dealing with someone who knew what they were talking about my queries always had to be referred back to the technical dept etc ;neutral
been elderly given more time to ask question required ;neutral
the lady at the service is not to blame she tried very hard it frustrates me the fact that for a hand held vacuum cleaner which is just 4 years old a tiny spare part which probably costs a few cents is no longer available instead it will be advised to buy a brand new vacuum cleaner this is really environmental awareness among all s  it's a pity that philps is not aware of his responsibility profit maximization at its best ;neutral
the fault i was complaining about was the nozzle assy on the airbrush being a poor design the customer service chap got the wrong end of the stick and sent me a new body but not the nozzle it was obvious he had misunderstood even though i sent photos disappointing ;neutral
my problem was not accepted as a material defect the alleged super offer is now available for 30 ;neutral
hardly anything i got the information i needed ie ok;neutral
find a solution ;neutral
follow up as the customer service center promises when they are going to check one thing and say they should answer you afterwards they must also follow up four times this did not happen ;neutral
better educate the people who work at the call centers on how your products work  i knew more about them ;neutral
i would buy an item but it is out of stock you cannot give notice when it is in stock again and even worse i cannot put the product on guard and get an email when it is in stock again it should be extremely easy to fix ;neutral
for me the quick answer was enough ;neutral
a satisfactory result;neutral
the promised e mail has been received but not the announced videos ;neutral
i have been very satisfied with the customer service nothing to complain about;neutral
make spare parts available for sale on line;neutral
the help i got was really good but was disappointed that the cost of the part was nearly as expensive as buying a new blender;neutral
the transaction was a bit complicated;neutral
that when calling speak with swedish speakers and not be connected further;neutral
the customer service was ok but unfortunately the result was very disappointing;neutral
the help was unfortunately not given as the product was what i did not want to get in your online store a tip where to buy the brushes would have been helpful ;neutral
no way ;neutral
the feedback came very fast unfortunately you can not help me with my product anymore ;neutral
sent the product back but still have not received my money after more than 2v from the time it was delivered to your office;neutral
the service was fine the disappointing thing was that this was the second time i have had to have one of these models repaired not the same iron and different problems ;neutral
it took too long to deal with;neutral
my initial contact with your service department was not really good it felt that i was being pressed into believing that i was doing something incorrect and that the fault i was experiencing did not exist ;neutral
i was most grateful that my steam generator was fixed at no charge despite being out of guarantee but unfortunately the same fault has since returned so this is the 3rd time the same fault has re occurred ;neutral
she could not help me after the midwives page is not quite working yet ;neutral
only on another request from me by mail i got the correct info i would have liked the first call already ;neutral
it took a very long time to solve the problem and involved taking photos and uploading of a serial number that was very difficult to see the replacement duly arrived after only a few months use it is sometimes difficult to switch on evcen though it is cleaned regularly and trouble shooting steps are taken ;neutral
i do not know  i would have preferred to receive the device fully functional;neutral
italian telephone operators ;neutral
well the replacement iron is no way as good as the one that broke so on this occasion i was dissatisfied;neutral
full replacement rather than repair the iron was very new when it went wrong;neutral
i'm a vine tester and got a vacuum cleaner from you that was not complete i had to pay for the missing part because i contacted you too late i find that extremely strange and not very customer friendly you do not always have time to check a delivery for completeness especially as it was at christmas time ;neutral
unfortunately my concern could not be clarified i have been for 2 months a coffee machine in a workshop for which a spare part should not be available subject boiler v4 230v including piston for saeco philips coffee machines art no the coffee machine is 2 5 years old and it is not possible to obtain a spare part unfortunately i could not be told where i can turn in this regard ;neutral
nothing the operators were very helpful and they answered immediately i had some problems with the email but otherwise everything is excellent ;neutral
that's okay thank you ;neutral
an instruction manual would have been helpful to read the many pages on the internet is actually an impertinence ;neutral
simpler website ;neutral
i still can not bring the plate to the assistance however it is not non stick and is dangerous because it moves easily and hot it moves because the food sticks and there are no cold grips to hold the plate and remove the food i would replace it with a voucher on another product thank you;neutral
i have had a recurring problem with the last three wet dry shavers within the guarantee period they have gone faulty with the on off switch and the ability to take a charge i have twice had a free replacement but the recent failure was on one of the replacements and although i felt it was still within the extended guarantee period because it was a replacement it had only one year guarantee i did receive a discount on another new purchase but feel that there must be some sort of design fault for this to keep happening ;neutral
no idea;neutral
no comment;neutral
unfortunately i will not buy the product i am looking for only for a coffee pot i spend no 40  a completely new machine you get already for 51  to order i will therefore choose a different brand with realistic prices and affordable prices for spare parts really a;neutral
to solve the problem;neutral
not sure it was no more or less than was expected;neutral
actually i am disappointed in the answer the customer service is ok but not the confusing manual on the ks has no influence for me a reason not to buy any more philips device ;neutral
got great help so i'm really happy;neutral
product not available online and only in store after order;neutral
a little more goodwill would not have been bad ;neutral
unfortunately the spare part does not give the addictions just the new flap;neutral
less complicated to us shorter clearer emails ;neutral
i thank for the moment nothing in case i need information i will contact you;neutral
the offer received was completely overpriced ;neutral
the service was good;neutral
nothing;neutral
everything ok ;neutral
if there is an alternative to the offending part quite unflexiebler vacuum cleaner hose make an offer immediately ;neutral
i think that providing a return label should not take a week other companies are there more swiftly or make this available immediately upon receipt of the goods apart from that i have not received a refund yet although the return was already delivered on 11 02 2019 ;neutral
to be fair it is the product i am disappointed with all the good customer servicing means nothing when you have paid a lot of money for an unreliable product no explanation why ;neutral
i had the impression that when i first contacted the friendly lady was overwhelmed with my requests the information given to me was inadequate re not my request of 14 or 15 february ;neutral
i received an email asking me to upload my receipt i didn  t even get a couple of day before i received another email telling me my case was closed not everyone spends;neutral
exactly answer the question ;neutral
absurd that after only 2 years you have to buy back my bodygrom because the battery does not recharge and the maximum you could offer me was 30% discount on vs online shop where the razor costs much more than on amazon ;neutral
send the right article was reclaimed the black travel case sent a white what my wife also used ;neutral
after refusing to accept the returned device from philips and blocking about 5 e mails with invoice and pictures i sent the device to the seller who handled the matter easily the customer representatives were very friendly and tried to help me ;neutral
collection not accommodating never called as directed to collect iron driver seemed not to look for workplace despite instruction ;neutral
for devices which go to 100% defect shortly after the statutory grant period a goodwill regulation should be feasible ;neutral
minimize correspondence 5 times written back and forth finally i asked over the phone because of the parcel slip again because i did not receive by mistake ok normality ????;neutral
everything went well i had answers;neutral
 employ people with an outgoing attitude 

regards peter ;neutral
more promotions;neutral
no coupon but a refund because i already have everything from avent that i need ;neutral
at the replacement of my device to replace me with an equivalent ;neutral
better product we have left it back ;neutral
having registered the product when purchased i didn  t expect to be asked questions about its purchase date and for proof of purchase there seemed little point in going through registration if i was still expected to hold o;neutral
i received the service which was expected and all of my queries were answered efficiently but the solution given was not sufficient to warrant giving a rating of happy or greater;neutral
less complicated process with order and longer delivery time ;neutral
closer to the customer's problem and not trying to sell something ;neutral
produce products that last longer than 5 years;neutral
my query was answered in that i was told to try again in a different browser;neutral
all right i opted for a different guaranty way via amazon ;neutral
nothing;neutral
be more proactive verbally showing that you care after all i'm receiving emails from you but once i had tried to register my product on line and by phone was impossible and without a help maybe was just lack of luck and a be day ;neutral
produce poem;neutral
reimbursement of expenses;neutral
the processing of feedback is slow ;neutral
accepted the receipt as seen on my phone by you without then requiring a copy of the same by email ;neutral
if both ordered items were delivered at the same time;neutral
your employees are braked in their action choices;neutral
more stable chat;neutral
philips product hu5930 10 it is bad if you put a product on the market but the spare parts or items are not available if a filter has a holder not only the filter but also the holder to be bought as a spare part or?;neutral
improve the device;neutral
i still can not log in;neutral
have received the info that you do not know when the goods were available instead 2 links were sent by partners but both did not have the article in the shop behold today goods available in the philips shop ;neutral
better informed when buying ;neutral
less waiting time more responsive to the customer ;neutral
until now nothing the process is still open ;neutral
my concern is not solved yet;neutral
previously the brush heads were printed with different motifs to distinguish i do not understand why that is not so ;neutral
for promotions phillips should arrange all issues not leave to the customer to check with the vendor for problems ;neutral
nothing;neutral
 i got an ok price for a new machine but would rather have seen a free spare part because my device otherwise worked ;neutral
instead of a discount for a shop purchase i would have liked the concrete solution to my problem;neutral
maybe suggest an alternative device;neutral
i needed a new handle for the water tank because of the poor quality again  was broken philips only offers an exchange of the entire water tank unnecessary waste of material and costs it also does not help because the handle also has no better quality disappointing at an otherwise good coffee machine ;neutral
the technicians you work to be more polite and willing;neutral
anything;neutral
there were differences between your service builder and philipps i had to wait several days in addition my fryer had to be sent in 2  times which was very inconvenient your co worker helped me a lot in the end conclusion everything very complicated and complicated ;neutral
nothing;neutral
more assistance for small appliances ;neutral
nothing;neutral
that's okay;neutral
the phone service ok but it is not serious to find on other sites the products vs 30% less than the vs offers i do not care to be contacted further good evening;neutral
had to dial 3 numbers to eventually finding the correct department query was about a senseo coffee maker told not the obvious coffee machines but i think it was baby products after a long discussion was told that basically the coffee maker was finished it was the 3rd one now they are obsolete ;neutral
it's a good service i would not change anything;neutral
you gave me a voucher of 25% on a purchase to be made on your site  pity that the price proposed by you i know on average 50% more expensive than the most popular ecommerce sites ;neutral
faster delivery of a replacement device for a defect delivered new device;neutral
nothing;neutral
not saorei;neutral
you could not offer me a solution to the problem described the good will was there but more than the manual gave nothing came ;neutral
ok;neutral
make a video baby monitor without wi fi;neutral
it was fine as it worked ;neutral
the sent in devices test correctly ;neutral
unfortunately there is no wakeup light with ipoddockingstation anymore but the very friendly customer service can not do anything ;neutral
link for accessories was provided but it didn't provide details of the mini size brush heads which was the size i was specifically interested in no confirmation was provided as to whether these particular brush heads are still available;neutral
a  60 blender is not working because a 30 pence rubber seal is not in stock and will be up to 3 weeks before i ;neutral
i do not know;neutral
too quiet on the phone ;neutral
 ask for a specific question not only after my criticism a concrete and not a wischi waschi answer this could easily be a negative purchase decision ;neutral
had been easier if the conversation could have been norwegian speaking;neutral
i do not know;neutral
show more goodwill from the beginning do not disappoint first;neutral
be a culprit unfortunately for personal reasons we have not been able to fulfill their requirements to start the program in time unfortunately they gave themselves very strict ;neutral
responded to me instead of me having to chase;neutral
it's going too long;neutral
quality of the philips aqua trio could have been better was therefore given back on amazon;neutral
all assistance is very far from my residence so far i have not yet been able to take it as a guarantee;neutral
it was a good answer but the product works again ;neutral
when ordering it was not possible to house number 194 and the block number stairs number 2 and the apartment number 8 lead there is not enough space for it ;neutral
you were very kind to fix my iron twice but really can't understand why it needed new parts each time it must have been faulty from the start ;neutral
improve your knife unit to your food processor they only last 2 3 months ;neutral
the elapsed time of the response has been long in the meantime i have proceeded to make a prior estimate of the assistance of bergamo the same informs me that the damage was card coffee grinder pump for an admonish of euro 185 i buy the new one ;neutral
nothing x hour article no longer available;neutral
on the one hand your colleague was very friendly led me on and sent me the available contacts for the device but both contacts could not help me because my philips coffee machine at the company and their contractors are no spare parts available and that after almost 3 years absolutely disappointing ;neutral
do not know;neutral
try believe me;neutral
a call back because of my request was promised me unfortunately this has not happened to this day ;neutral
the product ;neutral
online customer support;neutral
sorted the issue out without me having to call back 3 times;neutral
that's okay response in line with expectations;neutral
more influence on the decisions of the repair shop an exchange would have been correct device still with a lack of function;neutral
in swedish instead of english easier routines when changing and such ;neutral
sufficient and satisfying the current support with very kind telephonists;neutral
 responding to the needs of the customer instead of just the standard program ;neutral
more personal more detailed;neutral
it is my fault that ultimately i could not be helped i was recommended to send a photo of the defective milk can as well as the invoice of 25 6 2018 philipps however i could not find the documents and therefore can not assert my warranty claims  since i am back from vacation yesterday i will comb through all folders;neutral
i returned the machine due to quality defects ;neutral
since the marking of the panel on off switch had replaced me i did not want to swap the device immediately surely your technical service could have found a solution ;neutral
the service for my problem was fast and courteous so for now i can not ask for more;neutral
