I clicked on 'setup' to just peek at what the new features looked like and it moved a ton of files and started backing them up.  No 'start button', no 'are you ready' etc nothing.   This thing passed any sort of quality control lol??   What the hell.   At least Brenda helped us get things back working again.  Give here a raise and fire the people that were part of the new backup implementation and all will be good again in the Dropbox world.",Delighted

3235,Good rep. I'm leaving the Dropbox product after 10 years because the sync is just too slow for large video assets. Google Drive handles these files much better. Many colleagues say the same. Please look into this. As a Dropbox shareholder I would like to support your company instead of Google but I cannot when the core product has slow sync. Focus on fixing that instead of adding so many ancillary features.,Delighted

But maybe if my work's IT staff grant me full admin privileges to the kernel, I can get it working. It will be a problem for Dropbox if Apple is trying to strangle their access in favor of Apple's own products  I think you should sue them. :)",Delighted

But since our budget and staff is small (we're new; I'm the only employee), paying 45$ a month for the business account for one user just didn't make sense. That leaves our only option my using a personal account for the church.

10001,The agent was great. Jacob gets 5 stars. Your product team gets 1. My problem is with the Vault product and documentation. Vault does not work or integrate with Explorer.

10012,"The AI machine and/or human that attended me did its/his job well and without any difficulty. 
I find it interesting that Dropbox had my NEW credit card number, even though I never entered it into the website's billing info. Nor do I remember setting up automatic yearly billing. As a matter of fact, I did the opposite. 
And for this reason, I am not renewing my account this year.",Delighted
10013,The answer provided did not solve the problem. I did find out from an article online that the reason why only 4 hours of a 6 hour recording could be viewed in Dropbox is that this is a PREVIEW for holders of the business plan. And that the entire 6 hours WERE THERE and WOULD BE DOWNLOADED into the recipientâ€™s computer in full. Please let the person who responded to me know this. It was a very stressful time for me with a publisher waiting on the other end.,Delighted
10014,The app was poorly constructed when used on an iPhone.  But the associate was very helpful.,Delighted
10015,"The article you mentioned was useful, https://help.dropbox.com/installsintegrations/desktop/highcpuusage. It could be better, if you add a link to a list of known third party apps that could interact with dropbox. In my case, I think multiple opened heavy MS Office 365 Excels documents from dropbox folder could be the reason.",Delighted
10016,The assistance was exactly what I was looking for.  Cheers.,Delighted

When I called the first support line, and did a screen share to talk about my personal DB, the tech told me I was in the business one, and I couldn't talk to him on the phone anymore, that I had to chat with someone else instead for personal support.  I don't think that is a good policy  if I'm paying for multiple types of DB's, I should be allowed support for all of them the same.  I had to do a separate chat with someone else.  At least he was super knowledgeable and helped me!!",Delighted

I want to double click on the picture, save myself 2 dumb extra steps, and still be able to scroll from one picture to another.  I use Dropbox all of the time when I meet with customers.  I'm in sales.  It's just too time consuming and most of the time, it doesn't work and I have to stop and end the appointment.
